  "text": "Question 08) My dear Sherlock Holmes, something horrible happened at three in the morning in the Lauriston Garden. Our man who was in the watchman saw a light at two in the morning leaving an empty house. As he approached, he found the door open and, in the front room, the body of a well -dressed gentleman. The cards in his pocket were named Enoch J. Drebber, Cleveland, Ohio, USA. There was no robbery and our man could not find something that indicated how he died. There were no blood marks, no wounds in it. We don't know how he entered the empty house. In fact, every subject is an endless puzzle. If you can come to the house, it would be great, if not, I tell you the details and would love to know your opinion. Sincerely, Tobias Gregson.\nDOYLE, A. C. A study in red.
