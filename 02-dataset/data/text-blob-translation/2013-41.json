  "text": "Question 41) Products and their consumption are the declared goal of the technological enterprise. This goal was first proposed at the beginning of modernity as an expectation that man could master nature. However, this expectation, converted into a program announced by thinkers such as Descartes and Bacon and driven by the Enlightenment, did not arise “from a pleasure of power”, “from a mere human imperialism,” but from the aspiration of liberating man and enriching his Life, physically and culturally.\nCUPANI, A. Technology as a philosophical problem: three approaches. Authors of modern philosophy, notably Descartes and Bacon, and the Enlightenment project conceive science as a way of knowing that aims to free man from the weather of nature. In this context, scientific research consists of\nA) expose the essence of truth and definitely resolve the still existing theoretical disputes.\nB) offer the last word about things that exist and occupy the place that once was philosophy.\nC) be the expression of reason and serve as a model for other areas of knowledge that aims to progress.\nD) Explain the general laws that allow us to interpret nature and eliminate ethical and religious discourses.\nE) Explain the present dynamics between natural phenomena and impose limits on academic debates."
