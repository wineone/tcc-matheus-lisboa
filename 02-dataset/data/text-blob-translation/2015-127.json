  "text": "Question 122) Although particularities in technology -mediated production bring the writing of orality, this does not mean that people are writing wrong. Many seek only to adapt the use of language to the support used: “The context is that it defines the language record. If there is a space limit, of course, the subject will use more abbreviations, as he would do on paper, ”says a professor from the CEFET-MG Language and Technology Department. Similarly, it is necessary to consider the recipient's ability to correctly interpret the message issued. In the researcher's understanding, the school sometimes insists on teaching a record used only in specific contexts, which eventually discourages the student, who does not see meaning in employing such a model in other situations. Regardless of today's technological apparatus, the social use of language proves much more significant than its school use, as stressed by UFMG's director of scientific dissemination: “The dynamics of the oral language is always present. We do not speak or write the same way as our grandparents. ” Add to this that young people prove the main users of new technologies, through which they can easily communicate. However, the teacher points out that people need to have discernment about the different situations in order to master other codes.\nIn the wake of the development of information and communication technologies, particular uses of writing were emerging. Given this new reality, according to the text, it is up to the school to take the student to\nA) Interact through formal language in the digital context.\nB) Seek alternatives to establish better online contacts.\nC) adopt the use of the same norm in different technological supports.\nD) Develop skills to understand the texts posted on the web.\nE) perceive the specificities of languages ​​in different digital environments."
