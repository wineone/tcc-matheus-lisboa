  "text": "Question 51) Pesticides are highly toxic environmental contaminants to living beings and usually with great environmental persistence. The search for new forms of pesticide elimination has increased in recent years, as current techniques are economically expensive and palliative. Pesticide bioremediation using microorganisms has been a very promising technique for this purpose, as it has economic and environmental advantages.\nTo be used in this promising technique, a microorganism must be able to\nA) transfer the contaminant from the soil to the water.\nB) absorb the contaminant without chemically altering it.\nC) present a high mutation rate over generations.\nD) stimulate man's immune system against the contaminant.\nE) metabolize the contaminant, releasing less toxic or non -toxic by -products."
