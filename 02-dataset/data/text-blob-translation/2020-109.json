  "text": "Question 104) Carbon dioxide goes into solid state (dry ice) to −78 ° C and returns to the gaseous state at room temperature. Gas is easily solubilized in water, capable of absorbing infrared radiation from the earth's surface and does not conduct electricity. It is used as a raw material for photosynthesis to the saturation limit. After fixing by autotrophic organisms, the gas returns to the environment by aerobic respiration, fermentation, decomposition or industrial waste, burning fossil and burned fuels. Despite its ecological importance, its excess causes disturbances in environmental balance.\nConsidering the properties described, the atmospheric increase of the substance will affect aquatic organisms due to the\nA) Reduction of water hydrogen potential.\nB) Aerobiosis restriction by excess pollutants.\nC) decreased oxygen emission by autotrophs.\nD) limitation of energy transfer between living beings.\nE) retraction of the oceans by the freezing of the gas at the poles."
