  "text": "Question 146) A oil company has a reservoir in the shape of a rectangular parallelepiped with the dimensions given by 60 m x 10 m base and 10 m high. In order to minimize the environmental impact of a possible leakage, this reservoir is subdivided into three compartments, A, B and C, of ​​the same volume, by two 7 m high and 10 m base -dimensions, dimensions of rectangular steel plates, so that the compartments are interconnected, according to the figure. Thus, if there is a break in the reservoir hull, only part of your load will leak.\n10 m 10 m 60 m 7 m Suppose a disaster occurs when the oil company has its maximum load: it suffers an accident that causes a hole at the bottom of compartment C. For calculation or consider the thickness of the partition plates.\nAfter the end of the leak, the volume of poured oil will have been\nA) 1.4 × 103 m3\nB) 1.8 × 103 m3\nC) 2.0 × 103 m3\nD) 3.2 × 103 m3\nE) 6.0 × 103 m3"
