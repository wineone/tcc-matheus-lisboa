  "text": "Question 76) To protect corrosion steel structures, the industry uses a technique called galvanization. A metal widely used in this process is zinc, which can be obtained from a sphailer (ZNS), 75%purity. Consider that the conversion of ore into metallic zinc has 80% yield in this sequence of chemical equations: 2 zNS + 3 O2 → 2 ZNO + 2 SO2 ZNO + CO → Zn + CO2 Consider molar masses: ZNS (97 g/mol) ; O2 (32 g/mol); ZNO (81 g/mol); SO2 (64 g/mol); CO (28 g/mol); CO2 (44 g/mol); and Zn (65 g/mol).\nWhat closer value of metallic zinc mass, in kilograms, will be produced from 100 kg of sphailer?\nA) 25\nB) 33\nC) 40\nD) 50\nE) 54"
