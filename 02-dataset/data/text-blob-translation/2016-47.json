  "text": "Question 47) The Itaipu Plant is one of the largest hydroelectric dams in the world in power generation. With 20 generating units and 14 000 MW of total power installed, it has a drop of 118.4 m and nominal flow of 690 m3/s per generating unit. The calculation of the theoretical power takes into account the height of the dammed water mass by the dam, the local severity (10 m/s2) and the water density (1 000 kg/m3). The difference between the theoretical power and the installed is the unused power.\nWhat is the power, in MW, not used in each Itaipu generating unit?\nA) 0\nB) 1.18\nC) 116.96\nD) 816.96\nE) 13 183.04"
