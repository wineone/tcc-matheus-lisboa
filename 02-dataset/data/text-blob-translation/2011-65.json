  "text": "Question 65) In 1999, the geneticist Emma Whitelaw developed an experiment in which pregnant rats were subjected to a diet rich in vitamin B12, folic acid and soy. The puppies of these rats, although they had the gene for obesity, did not express this disease in adulthood. The author concluded that the mother's diet during pregnancy silenced the obesity gene. Ten years later, geneticists Eva Jablonka and Gal Raz listed 100 proven cases of traits acquired and transmitted between generations of organisms, thus supporting epigenetics, which studies changes in gene activity that does not involve changes in the sequence of DNA.\nSome sporadic cancers represent examples of epigenetic alteration, as they are caused by\nA) Aneuploidia of the sex chromosome X.\nB) Polypoidia of the autosomal chromosomes.\nC) mutation in autosomal genes with dominant expression.\nD) replacement in the hemoglobin beta gene gene.\nE) Inactivation of genes through changes in nitrogenous bases."
