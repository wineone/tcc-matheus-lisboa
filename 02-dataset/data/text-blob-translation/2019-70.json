  "text": "Question 65) For Machiavelli, when a man decides to tell the truth by endangering his own physical integrity, such a resolution refers only to his person. But if this same man is a head of state, personal criteria are no longer suitable for deciding on actions whose consequences become so wide, as the damage will not only be individual but collective. In this case, according to the circumstances and purposes to be achieved, it can be decided that the best for the common good is to lie.\nARANHA, M. L. Machiavelli: The Logic of Force. The text points to an innovation in political theory in modern times expressed in the distinction between\nA) Ideality and effectiveness of morals.\nB) nullity and preserving freedom.\nC) illegality and legitimacy of the ruler.\nD) Verifiability and possibility of the truth.\nE) objectivity and subjectivity of knowledge."
