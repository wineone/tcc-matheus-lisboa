In the Senate, Cayru Viscount was one of the advocates that the girls' math curriculum was as lean as possible. In his words, “beautiful sex” had no intellectual ability to go far away: - About the accounts, they are quite [for girls] the four species, which are not out of reach and can be constantly used in life .\nText II in the Senate, the only one to publicly defend that girls had, in mathematics, a curriculum identical to that of the boys was the Marquis of Santo Amaro (RJ). He argued: - It does not seem to me, in the light of the time we live in, we fail to facilitate the Brazilian acquisition of these knowledge [more in -depth math]. The opposition that manifests itself cannot be born but the root and bad custom in which the ancients were, who did not even want their daughters to learn to read.\nThe discourses express divergent points of view respectively by the opposition between\nA) Freedom of gender and social control.\nB) equity of choice and cultural imposition.\nC) domination of bodies and human equality.\nD) Opportunity generation and professional restriction.\nE) exclusion of competences and political participation."
