  "text": "Question 54) On a very strong rainy day, there was a drip over the center of a covered pool, forming a standard of circular waves. In this situation, it was observed that two drops fell every second. The distance between two consecutive ridges was 25 cm and each approached the edge of the pool at a speed of 1.0 m/s. After a while the rain decreased and the drip dropd once a second.\nWith the decrease in rain, the distance between the ridges and the wave propagation speed have become, respectively,\nA) greater than 25 cm and greater than 1.0 m/s.\nB) greater than 25 cm and equal to 1.0 m/s.\nC) less than 25 cm and less than 1.0 m/s.\nD) less than 25 cm and equal to 1.0 m/s.\nE) equal to 25 cm and equal to 1.0 m/s."
