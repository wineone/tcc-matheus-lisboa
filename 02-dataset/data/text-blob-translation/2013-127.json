  "text": "Question 122) Liv Chapter - The pendula came out to taste the kiss. I couldn't sleep; I estimate me in bed, of course, but it was the same as nothing. I heard the hours all at night. Usually, when I lost sleep, the beating of the pendula was very badly; This crumbly, slow, dry tickery seemed to tell every blow that I was going to have a less life. He then imagined an old devil, sitting between two bags, that of life and that of death, and to tell them like this:-Another less ...\n- Another less ...\n- Another less ...\n- Another less ...\nThe most unique thing is that if the clock stopped, I would go, so that it would never stop beating, and I could tell all my lost moments. Inventions are, which transform or end; The same institutions die; The clock is definitive and perpetual. The ultimate man, saying goodbye to the cold and spent sun, will have a clock in the pocket, to find out the exact time when he dies.\nThat night I did not suffer this sad feeling of boring, but another, and delightful. The fantasies tumultured inside me, they came to each other, like devouts who collapsed to see the processions-angel. I didn't hear the lost moments, but the minutes gained.\nASSIS, M. Posthumous memories of Brás Cubas. Rio de Janeiro: Nova Aguilar, 1992 (Fragment).\nThe chapter presents the moment Brás Cubas revives the sensation of the kiss changed with Virgília, married to Wolf Neves. In this context, the clock metaphor deconstructs certain romantic paradigms, because\nA) The narrator and Virgilia have no perception of time in his adulterous encounters.\nB) As “deceased author”, Brás Cubas recognizes the uselessness of trying to follow the flow of time.\nC) In counting the hours, the narrator metaphorizes the desire to triumph and accumulate riches.\nD) The clock represents the materialization of time and redirects the idealistic behavior of Brás Cubas.\nE) The narrator compares the duration of the taste of the kiss to the perpetuity of the clock."
