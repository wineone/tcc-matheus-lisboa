  "text": "Question 102) Carbon-14 technique allows fossil dating by measuring beta emission values ​​of this isotope present in the fossil. For a being in life, the maximum is 15 emissions beta/(min g). After death, the amount of 14C is half reduced every 530 years.\nConsider that a mass fossil fragment equal to 30 g was found in an archaeological site, and radiation measurement presented 6 750 beta emissions per hour. The age of this fossil, in years, is\nA) 450.\nB) 1 433.\nC) 11 460.\nD) 17 190.\nE) 27 000."
