  "text": "Question 76) Some security systems include motion detectors. In these sensors, there is a substance that polarizes the presence of electromagnetic radiation of a certain frequency region, generating a tension that can be amplified and employed for control purposes. When a person approaches the system, the radiation emitted by their body is detected by this type of sensor.\nRadiation captured by this detector is in the frequency region\nA) Visible light.\nB) Ultraviolet.\nC) of the infrared.\nD) the microwave.\nE) the long radio waves."
