  "text": "Question 109) Researchers have been able to stimulate the absorption of light energy in plants thanks to the use of carbon nanotubes. For this, carbon nanotubes “inserted” inside the chloroplasts by a spontaneous montage through the chloroplast membranes. Plant pigments absorb light radiation, electrons are “excited” and move inside chloroplast membranes, and the plant then uses this electricity for the manufacture of sugars. Carbon nanotubes can absorb wavelengths commonly not used by chloroplasts, and researchers had the idea of ​​using them as “antennas”, stimulating the conversion of solar energy by chloroplasts, with increasing electron transportation.\nCarbon nanotubes increase plant photosynthesis. Increased photosynthetic efficiency occurred because carbon nanotubes promote directly to\nA) Water use.\nB) absorption of photons.\nC) Oxygen gas formation.\nD) Proliferation of chloroplasts.\nE) Carbon dioxide capture."
