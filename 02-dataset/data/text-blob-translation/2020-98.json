  "text": "Question 93) Nanotechnology can be characterized when compounds are in the order of millimeters of millimeters, such as the use of catalytic nanomaterials in industrial processes. The use of these materials increases the efficiency of production, consumes less energy and generates smaller amounts of waste. The success of this technological application is often related to the increase in the speed of the chemical reaction involved.\nThe success of the application of this technology is because of the accomplishment of chemical reactions that occur under conditions of\nA) High pressure.\nB) High temperature.\nC) Excessive reagents.\nD) larger contact surface.\nE) high activation energy."
