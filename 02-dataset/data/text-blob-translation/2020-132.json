This type of interference in the environment threatens biodiversity. Imagine that a jaguar population has been isolated in a small forest. They would be extinguished even without being slaughtered. Several components of Habitat Island, such as size, heterogeneity, surroundings, connectivity and edge effect are determinant for the persistence or not of the original species.\nA measure that helps in the conservation of biodiversity in the islands mentioned in the text comprises the\nA) Micro-habitat formation.\nB) expansion of the edge effect.\nC) Construction of ecological corridors.\nD) Promotion of ecological succession.\nE) Introduction of new species of animals and plants."
