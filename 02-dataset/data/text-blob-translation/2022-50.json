  "text": "Question 45) Recife was sealing in the early 1990s, and artists worked to rescue the prestige of Pernambuco culture. It was necessary to be inspired literally in the roots on which the city was built. It was there that, in 1992, with the publication of a manifesto written by musician and journalist Fred Zero Quatro, from the band Mundo Livre S/A, the Manguebeat was born. The name comes from “mangrove”, typical vegetation of the region, and “beat”, to represent the beats and musical influences that the movement would embrace from there. It was the time and turn of the crabs-to which the Recife musicians liked to compare themselves-show the guys: maracatu and their implements mingled with hip hop beats, rock guitars, electronic elements and accents reef from Chico Science. The search for the new yielded a different perspective from Brazil when looking at Recife. The city is no longer the place only of frevo and carnival, becoming the musical boiling that continues to happen even after the 25th anniversary of the first album of the Zombie nation, from mud to chaos.\nChico Science was fundamental for the renewal of Pernambuco music, a fact that was\nA) Use of electronic musical devices instead of traditional instruments.\nB) occupation of local nature spaces for the production of memorable musical events.\nC) replacement of old musical practices, such as frevo, with innovative melodies and harmonies.\nD) Recovery of traditional folk compositions and their presentation at major festivals.\nE) Integration of cultural references from different origins, creating a new aesthetic combination."
