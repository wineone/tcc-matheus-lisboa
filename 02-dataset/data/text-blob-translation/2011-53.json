  "text": "Question 53) The human papilloma virus (HPV) causes the appearance of warts and persistent infection, being the main environmental factor of cervical cancer in women. The virus can enter the skin or mucous membranes of the body, which develops antibodies against the threat, although in some cases the body's natural defense is not sufficient. A HPV vaccine was developed, which reduces warts and 85.6% of persistent infection compared to non -vaccinated people by up to 90%.\nThe benefit of using this vaccine is that vaccinated people, compared to non -vaccinated, have different responses to the HPV virus as a result of\nA) High concentration of macrophages.\nB) High rate of specific anti-HPV antibodies.\nC) Increased red blood cell production after HPV virus infection.\nD) speed in the production of high concentrations of killer lymphocytes.\nE) presence of memory cells that act in the secondary response."
