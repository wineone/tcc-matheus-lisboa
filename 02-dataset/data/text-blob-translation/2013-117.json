Indeed, vitamin D can be produced naturally by sunlight exposure, but it also exists in some ordinary foods. However, as a source of this vitamin, certain foods are better than others. Some have a significant amount of vitamin D, of course, and are foods that you may not want to exaggerate: butter, cream, egg yolk and liver.\nText II We all know that vitamin D (Colecalciferol) is crucial to your health. But is vitamin D really a vitamin? Is it present in the foods that humans normally consume? Although there is some percentage in fish fat, vitamin D is not in our diets unless humans artificially increase a food product, such as vitamin D -enriched milk. Nature has planned that you produce it on your skin, and not put her straight into her mouth.\nSo would it really be vitamin D a vitamin? It often circulates in the media texts of scientific dissemination that present divergent information on the same theme. Comparing the two texts, it is found that text II is opposed to I when\nA) Scientifically proves that vitamin D is not a vitamin.\nB) demonstrates the true importance of vitamin D for health.\nC) emphasizes that vitamin D is most commonly produced by the body that absorbed through food.\nD) states that vitamin D exists in fish fat and milk, not in its derivatives.\nE) raises the possibility of the human body artificially produce vitamin D."
