  "text": "QUESTION 66) The rise in the temperature of the water, lakes and seas waters decreases the solubility of oxygen, endangering the various forms of aquatic life that depend on this gas. If this temperature rise happens by artificial means, we say there is thermal pollution. Nuclear plants, by the very nature of the energy generation process, can cause this type of pollution.\nWhat is part of the power generation cycle of nuclear plants associated with this type of pollution?\nA) fission of radioactive material.\nB) condensation of water vapor at the end of the process.\nC) energy conversion of turbines by generators.\nD) heating of liquid water to generate water vapor.\nE) launch of water vapor on turbine blades."
