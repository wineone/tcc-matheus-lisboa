  "text": "Question 110) In the retroviridae family there are several viruses that infect birds and mammals, being characterized by DNA production from a RNA molecule. Some retroviruses infect exclusively humans, not requiring other hosts, reservoirs or biological vectors. Infections caused by these viruses have been causing deaths and major damage to social and economic development. In this context, researchers have produced medicines that contribute to the treatment of these diseases.\nWhat technological advances have contributed to the treatment of these viral infections?\nA) Improvement of vector control methods of these viruses.\nB) Manufacture of mutagenic sera to combat these viruses.\nC) Industry investment in personal protective equipment.\nD) production of vaccines that prevent host cell infection.\nE) development of antiretrovirals that make it difficult to reproduce these viruses."
