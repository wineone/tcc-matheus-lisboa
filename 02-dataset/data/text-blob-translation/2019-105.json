  "text": "Question 100) Two friends meet at a gas station to calibrate the tires of their bicycles. One of the bikes is running (bicycle A) and the other, walking (bicycle B). The tires of both bicycles have the same characteristics, except that the width of A tires is less than the width of B tires. When calibrating bicycles A and B tires, respectively with PA and PB calibration pressures, friends Note that the bicycle tire A deformation, at the same effort, much less than the Bicycle B tire. It can be considered that the compressed air masses on the bicycle A, MA, and the bicycle B, MB, are directly proportional to their volumes.\nComparing the pressures and masses of compressed air on bicycle tires, we have:\nA) PA <pb and ma <mb\nB) PA> PB and MA <MB\nC) PA> PB and MA = MB\nD) pa <pb and ma = mb\nE) PA> PB and MA> MB"
