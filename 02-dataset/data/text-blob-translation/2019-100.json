  "text": "Question 95) High voltage networks for electricity transmission generate enough variable magnetic field to induce electric current in the fence wire. Both animals and employees of rural properties or energy dealers should be very careful when approaching a fence when it is close to a high voltage network, as if they touch the fence wire, they may suffer electric shock.\nTo minimize this type of problem, one should:\nA) Ground the wires of the fence.\nB) Add security fuse in the fence.\nC) Ground the high voltage network.\nD) Install security fuse on the high voltage network.\nE) Use covered wires with insulator on the high voltage network."
