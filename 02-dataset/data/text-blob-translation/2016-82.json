  "text": "QUESTION 82) An invention that significant a great technological advance in antiquity, the composite pulley or the association of pulleys, is attributed to Archimedes (287 BC to 212 BC). The apparatus consists of associating a series of mobile pulleys with a fixed pulley. Figure exemplifies a possible arrangement for this apparatus. It is reported that Archimedes would have demonstrated to King Hieraon another arrangement of this apparatus, moving alone, over the beach sand, a ship full of passengers and cargo, something that would be impossible without the participation of many men. Suppose the ship's mass was 3,000 kg, that the static friction coefficient between the ship and the sand was 0.8 and that Archimedes pulled the ship with a force F â†’, parallel to the direction of movement and module equal to 400 N. Consider the ideal fines and pulleys, the acceleration of gravity equal to 10 m/s2 and that the surface of the beach is perfectly horizontal.\nThe minimum number of mobile pulleys used, in this situation, by Archimedes was\nA) 3.\nB) 6.\nC) 7.\nD) 8.\nE) 10."
