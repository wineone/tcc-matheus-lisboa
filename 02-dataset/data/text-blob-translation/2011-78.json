  "text": "Question 80) According to data from the 2008 National Energy Balance, the Ministry of Mines and Energy, the Brazilian Energy Matrix is ​​composed of hydroelectric (80%), thermoelectric (19.9%) and wind (0.1%). In thermoelectric plants, this percentage is divided according to the fuel used, being: natural gas (6.6%), biomass (5.3%), petroleum derivatives (3.3%), nuclear energy (3.1%) and Mineral coal (1.6%). With the generation of biomass electricity, it can be considered that a carbon compensation is cleared in the burning of plant material by absorbing this element in plant growth. However, studies indicate that hydroelectric methane emissions (CH4) may be comparable to the CO2 emissions of thermoelectric plants.\nMORET, A. S.; FERREIRA, I. A. The hydroelectric dams of the Madeira River and the social and environmental impacts in Brazil, in terms of the impact of energy sources on greenhouse growth, as to the emission of gas, hydroelectric plants would be considered as a source\nA) Clean energy, contributing to minimize the effects of this phenomenon.\nB) effective energy, taking the percentage of supply and the benefits verified.\nC) Clean of energy, not affecting or changing greenhouse gas levels.\nD) polluting, collaborating with high levels of greenhouse gas due to its supply potential.\nE) alternative, taking by reference to the large emission of greenhouse gases of the other generating sources."
