  "text": "Question 30) Text I strata in the passage from one language to another, something always remains, even if there is no one to remember this. For a language retains more memories in it than its speakers and, like a mineral plate marked by layers of an older story than that of living beings, inevitably carries the impression of the ages through which it has gone through. If “languages ​​are archives of history,” they lack registration books and catalogs. What they contain can only be consulted in part, providing the researcher less the elements of a biography than a geological study of sedimentation performed in a period without a defined start or end.\nHELLER-ROAZEN, D. Elalias: About the forgetfulness of languages. Campinas: UNICAMP, 2010.\nText II In the grammatical reflection of the 16th and 17th centuries, the Arab influence appears punctually, and is mainly covered by a fundamental war item in the attribution of rudeness to the Portuguese and Castilian languages ​​for their respective detractors.
