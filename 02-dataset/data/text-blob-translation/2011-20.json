  "text": "Question 20) Although Brazil is a signatory to international conventions and treaties against torture and has incorporated into its legal system a law typifying the crime, it continues to occur largely. Even though the law that typifies torture has been in force since 1997, until 2000 there is no case of condemnation of torturers ultimately judged, although there were hundreds of cases, as well as numerous other presumed but not registered. .\nThe text highlights the issue of torture in the country, pointing out that\nA) Brazilian justice, through treaties and laws, has been able to inhibit and even extinguish the practice of torture.\nB) The existence of the law is not enough as a guarantee of justice for the victims and witnesses of the cases of torture.\nC) Anonymous complaints make it difficult for justice to be action, preventing torturers from being recognized and identified for the crime committed.\nD) the lack of registration of torture by the police authorities, due to the lack of knowledge of torture as a crime, legitimizes impunity.\nE) Justice has bumped into the precarious existence of jurisprudence about torture, which prevents it from acting in these cases."
