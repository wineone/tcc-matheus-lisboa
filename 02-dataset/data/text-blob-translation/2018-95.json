Exemplary, in this sense, is the affirmation of a Supreme Court judge of the United States, on the occasion of an election of 1902: “The electoral cabin is the temple of American institutions, where each of us is a priest, to which he is entrusted the guard of the ark of the covenant and each officer of his own altar. ”\nThe metaphors used in the text refer to a conception of democracy based on\nA) Theistic justification of law.\nB) rigidity of the class hierarchy.\nC) Formalist emphasis on administration.\nD) protagonism of the executive in power.\nE) centrality of the individual in society."
