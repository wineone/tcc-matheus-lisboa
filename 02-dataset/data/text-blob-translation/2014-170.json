A number N is given by the expression 2x ⋅ 5y ⋅ 7z, in which x, y and z are non -negative integers. It is known that n is a multiple of 10 and is not a multiple of 7.\nThe number of divisors of n, different from n, is\nA) x ⋅ y ⋅ z\nB) (x + 1) ⋅ (y + 1)\nC) x ⋅ y ⋅ z - 1\nD) (x + 1) ⋅ (y + 1) ⋅ z\nE) (x + 1) ⋅ (y + 1) ⋅ (z + 1) - 1"
