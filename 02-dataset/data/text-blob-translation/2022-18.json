  "text": "Question 13) There are several factors, internal and external, which influence people's habits in internet access, as well as cultural practices performed on the network. The use of information and communication technologies is directly related to aspects such as: knowledge of its use, access to literate language, level of instruction, education, digital literacy, etc. Those who have such resources (the most educated) are the ones that most access the network and also those that have the highest rate of practices accumulative. The analysis of the data makes it possible to say that the lack of access to the network repeats the same adversities and exclusions already verified in Brazilian society regarding illiterates, less educated, blacks, indigenous and unemployed population. This means that the internet, if it does not directly produce exclusion, certainly reproduces it, considering that those who access it most are precisely the younger, educated, paid, qualified workers, men and white.\nIn analyzing the correlation between the habits and the socioeconomic profile of internet users in Brazil, the researchers\nA) point to economic development as a solution to expand the use of the network.\nB) question the belief that access to information is egalitarian and democratic.\nC) state that commercial use of the network is the cause of minority exclusion.\nD) refute the bond between levels of education and difficulty of access.\nE) condition the expansion of the network to the elaboration of inclusive policies."
