  "text": "Question 83) Ethanol is considered a promising biofuel, because, from the point of view of the carbon balance, it has an emission rate practically zero. However, this is not the only biogeochemical cycle associated with ethanol production. Planting sugarcane, raw material for ethanol production, involves the addition of macronutrients such as sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, main elements involved in the growth of a vegetable. Nova Chemistry Magazine at School. No 28, 2008.\nNitrogen incorporated into the soil as a consequence of the activity described above is transformed into active nitrogen and will affect the environment, causing\nA) The accumulation of insoluble salts, triggering a soil salinification process.\nB) the elimination of existing soil microorganisms responsible for the denitrification process.\nC) The contamination of rivers and lakes due to the high solubility of ions such as NO3 - and NH4 + in water.\nD) the decrease in soil pH by the presence of NH3, which reacts with water, forming the NH4OH (aq).\nE) decreased soil oxygenation, since active nitrogen forms chemical species of type NO2, NO3 -, n2O."
