  "text": "Question 89) In the early 1990s, two important biologists, Redford and Robinson, produced a widely accepted model of “sustainable production” that predicted how many individuals in each species could be sustainable hunted based on their reproduction rates. The rubber tings of Alto Juruá had a different model: whom they told them that they were hunting above the sustainable (within the model), they said no, that the level of hunting depended on the existence of areas of refuge in which no one hunted. Now, this turned out to be the model baptized as a “source-ral” proposed ten years after the first by Novaro, Bodmer and the Redford itself and that supplanted the previous model.\nCUNHA, M. C. USP Magazine, n. 75, Sep.-Nov. 2007.\nIn the context of scientific production, the need for reconstruction of this model, as stated in the text, was determined by the confrontation with a (a)\nA) Operational conclusion obtained by deductive logic.\nB) worldview marked by moral prejudices.\nC) social habit conditioned by popular religiosity.\nD) empirical knowledge appropriate by common sense.\nE) preservation pattern built by directed experimentation."
