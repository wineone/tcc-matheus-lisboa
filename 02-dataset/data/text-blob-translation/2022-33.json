  "text": "Question 28) Brazil's silenced languages ​​to learn the language of their people, Professor Txaywa Pataxó, 29, had to study the factors that, several times, almost caused the extinction of the Patxôhã language. He plunged into the history of Brazil and discovered violent facts that dispersed the Pataxós, forced to abandon his own language to escape persecution. “The Pataxós spread mainly after the 1951 fire. They burned everything and kicked out of our lands. This embarrasses our people to this day, ”says Txaywa, a student at the Federal University of Minas Gerais and a teacher at the Barra Velha Village, Porto Seguro region (BA). More than four decades later, members of the ethnicity returned to the old site and began a Patxôhã language recovery movement. Sameary Pataxó's children are already fluent - and she, who moved when she was an adult to the village, tries to learn a little from them. “It's our identity. You say who you are through your language, ”says the elementary school teacher about the importance of restoring the language of Pataxós. Patxôhã is among the indigenous languages ​​spoken in Brazil: IBGE estimated 274 languages ​​in the last census. The publication indigenous peoples in Brazil 2011/2016, of the Socio -Environmental Institute, calculates 160. Before the arrival of the Portuguese, they totaled more than a thousand.\nThe Patxôhã language recovery movement assumes a peculiar identity character as\nA) denounces the process of historical persecution suffered by indigenous peoples.\nB) combines the act of ethnic resistance to the preservation of cultural memory.\nC) associates linguistic preservation with the field of academic research.\nD) stimulates the return of indigenous peoples to their lands of origin.\nE) increases the number of indigenous languages ​​spoken in Brazil."
