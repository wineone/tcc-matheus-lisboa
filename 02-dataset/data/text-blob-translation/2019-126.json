Its recombinant forms, synthesized in the laboratory, have been used by some resistance sports athletes in search of better results. However, the administration of the recombinant EPO in sport was prohibited by the International Olympic Committee and its use considered doping.\nMARTELLI, A. Erythropoetin: synthesis and physiological release and the use of its recombinant form in sport. Online perspectives: an influence that this doping can exert in improving the physical capacity of these athletes is related to the transportation of\nA) lipids, to increase caloric expenditure.\nB) ATP, to increase hormonal synthesis.\nC) Oxygen, to increase the production of ATP.\nD) proteins, to increase muscle mass.\nE) vitamin C, to increase the integrity of blood vessels."
