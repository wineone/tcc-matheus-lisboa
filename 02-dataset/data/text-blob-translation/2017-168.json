  "text": "Question 163) A designer designer should draw a pan lid in a circular form. To perform this design, it has only one measure at the moment, whose length of the rods is 10 cm, a transfer and a sheet of paper with a Cartesian plane. To sketch the design of this lid, she pushed the stems out of her compass so that the angle formed by them was 120 °. The dried tip is represented by point C, the tip of the graph is represented by point B and the head of the compass is represented by point A as figure.\n120 ° Y x 1 0 3 After completing the drawing, it forwards it to the production sector. Upon receiving the drawing with the radius of the lid, checks which interval it is in and will decide the type of material to be used in its manufacture, according to the data.\nMaterial Type Radius Value Interval (cm) 0 <R ≤ 5 II 5 <R ≤ 10 III 10 <R ≤ 15 IV 15 <R ≤ 21 <R ≤ 40 Consider 1.7 as approach to 3.\nThe type of material to be used by the production sector will be\nTHERE.\nB) II.\nC) III.\nD) IV.\nE) V."
