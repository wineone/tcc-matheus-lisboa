  "text": "Question 122) The purpose of thermal insulating containers is to minimize heat exchanges with the external environment. This heat exchange is proportional to the thermal conductivity K and the internal area of ​​the container faces, as well as the temperature difference between the external environment and the interior of the container, and is inversely proportional to the thickness of the faces.\nIn order to evaluate the quality of two containers A (40 cm × 40 cm × 40 cm) and B (60 cm × 40 cm × 40 cm), of the same thick faces, a student compares his thermal conductivities Ka and KB. For this, suspend, inside each container, identical blocks of ice at 0 ° C, so that their surfaces are in contact with the air only. After a time interval, it opens the containers while both still contain some ice and finds that the ice mass that merged in container B was twice the one that merged in the A container A.\nThe Ka KB reason is closer to\nA) 0.50.\nB) 0.67.\nC) 0.75.\nD) 1.33.\nE) 2.00."
