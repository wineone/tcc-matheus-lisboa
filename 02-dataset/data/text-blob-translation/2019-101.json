The contagion occurs after the worm larvae are released into the water by the snail of the genus Biomphalaria, its intermediate host, and penetrate the human skin. After diagnosis, traditional treatment uses oral medicines to kill the parasite within the body. A new therapeutic strategy is based on the use of a vaccine, made from a protein extracted from the worm, which induces the human body to produce antibodies to combat and prevent the disease.\nOswaldo Cruz Institute/Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (IOC/Fiocruz). Fiocruz an advantage of the vaccine in relation to traditional treatment is that it can\nA) Prevent parasite penetration through the skin.\nB) eliminate snail so that there is no contagion.\nC) prevent schistosome access specifically for the liver.\nD) eliminate the schistosomome before contact with the body occurs.\nE) eliminate the schistosome within the body before the manifestation of symptoms."
