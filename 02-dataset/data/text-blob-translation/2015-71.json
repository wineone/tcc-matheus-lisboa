  "text": "Question 71) Several acids are used in industries that discard their effluents in water bodies, such as rivers and lakes, and may affect environmental balance. To neutralize acidity, calcium carbonate salt can be added to the effluent in appropriate amounts as it produces baking soda that neutralizes water. The equations involved in the process are presented: (i) CaCO3 (s) + CO2 (g) + H2O (L) Ca2 + (aq) + 2 HCO3 - (aq) (II) HCO3 - (aq) H + (aq) + co3 2- (aq) k1 = 3.0 × 10-11 (III) CaCO3 (s) Ca2 + (aq) + CO3 2- (aq) K2 = 6.0 × 10-9 (IV) CO2 (g) + H2O (L) H + (aq) + HCO3 - (aq) k3 = 2.5 × 10-7 based on the values ​​of reactions of reactions II, III and IV to 25 ° C, what is the numerical value of the constant of Reaction Balance I?\nA) 4.5 × 10-26\nB) 5.0 × 10-5\nC) 0.8 × 10-9\nD) 0.2 × 105\nE) 2.2 × 1026"
