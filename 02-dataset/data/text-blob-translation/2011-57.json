  "text": "Question 57) Biological control, a technique employed in combating species that cause damage and damage to humans, is used to combat the caterpillar that feeds on cotton leaves. Some butterfly species lay their eggs in this culture. Microvespa Trichogramma sp. Introduces your eggs into the eggs of other insects, including those of the butterflies in question. Wasp embryos feed on the content of these eggs and prevent butterfly larvae from developing. Thus, it is possible to reduce the population density of butterflies to levels that do not harm culture.\nThe biological control technique performed by Microvespa Trichogramma SP. consists of\nA) Introduction of a parasite in the environment of the species that you want to fight.\nB) Introduction of a lethal gene into butterflies in order to reduce the number of individuals.\nC) competition between the butterfly and the microvespa to obtain resources.\nD) Modification of the environment to select better adapted individuals.\nE) application of insecticides in order to decrease the number of individuals to be combated."
