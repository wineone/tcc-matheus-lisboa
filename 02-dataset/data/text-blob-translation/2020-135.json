  "text": "Question 130) In a power generating plant, either through a waterfall or through pressure vapor, the generator blades are turned to rotate. The relative movement of a magnet in relation to a set of coils produces a variable magnetic flow through them, generating a potential difference in its terminals. During the operation of one of the generators, the plant operator realized that there was an unexpected increase in the difference in electrical potential at the coil terminals. In this situation, the increase in the potential difference module obtained in the coil terminals results from the increase in (a)\nA) time interval when the coils are immersed in the external magnetic field by means of a reduction in speed in the generator rotation axis.\nB) magnetic flow through the coils, through an increase in its internal area exposed to the applied magnetic field.\nC) intensity of the magnetic field in which the coils are immersed by applying more intense magnetic fields.\nD) speed with which magnetic flow varies through the coils, through an increase in their angular velocity.\nE) internal resistance of the conductor that constitutes the coils, through an increase in terminal thickness."
