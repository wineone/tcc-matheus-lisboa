  "text": "Question 53) Serpents who inhabit drought regions can be fasting for a long period of time due to food scarcity. Thus, the survival of these predators is related to the maximum use of the nutrients obtained with the captured prey. According to this situation, these snakes have morphological and physiological changes, such as the increase in intestinal villi and the intensification of blood irrigation in the internal portion of these structures.\nThe function of increasing intestinal villi for these snakes is to maximize (a)\nA) length of the gastrointestinal tract to fit more food.\nB) contact area with intestinal content for nutrient absorption.\nC) Heat release via blood irrigation for thermal control of the digestive system.\nD) Digestive enzyme secretion to increase protein degradation in the stomach.\nE) Digestion process to decrease the time of food permanence in the intestine."
