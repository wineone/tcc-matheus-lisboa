  "text": "Question 84) In an experiment, a teacher leaves two trays of the same pasta, one plastic and one of aluminum, on the laboratory table. After a few hours, he asks students to evaluate the temperature of the two trays, using the tact. Its students categorically affirm that the aluminum tray is at a lower temperature. Intrigued, he proposes a second activity, which places an ice cube over each of the trays, which are in thermal equilibrium with the environment, and asks them to which the ice melt rate will be higher.\nThe student who correctly responds to the teacher's questioning will say that the melting will occur\nA) Faster in the aluminum tray, as it has greater thermal conductivity than plastic.\nB) faster in the plastic tray, as it initially has a higher temperature than aluminum.\nC) faster in the plastic tray, as it has a greater thermal capacity than aluminum.\nD) faster in the aluminum tray, as it has a specific heat smaller than that of plastic.\nE) with the same speed in both trays as they will have the same temperature variation."
