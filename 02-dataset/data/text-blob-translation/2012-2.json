  "text": "Question 02) Clarification is the departure of man from his minority, from which he is guilty himself. Minority is the inability to make use of its understanding without the direction of another individual. Man is the very guilty of this minority if its cause is not in the lack of understanding, but in the lack of decision and courage to use itself without the direction of others. You have the courage to make use of your own understanding, such is the motto of enlightenment. Laziness and cowardice are the causes by which a large part of men, after the nature of the long -lived nature has freed them from a strange condition, however, continued to be smaller for a good way.\nKant highlights in the text the concept of enlightenment, fundamental to understanding the philosophical context of modernity. Clarification, in the sense employed by Kant, represents\nA) The claim of rational capacity autonomy as an expression of age.\nB) the exercise of rationality as a minor assumption in the face of eternal truths.\nC) the imposition of mathematical truths, with objective character, in a heteronomous manner.\nD) Understanding religious truths that frequent man from lack of understanding.\nE) the emancipation of the human subjectivity of ideologies produced by reason itself."
