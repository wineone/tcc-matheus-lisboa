  "text": "Question 110) Common sense is that only humans are capable of laughing. This is not true? No. The basic laugh - that of play, fun, physical expression of laughter, movement movement and vocalization - we share with various animals. In rats, ultrasonic vocalizations have already been observed - which we are not able to realize - and that they emit when they are playing \"rolling on the floor.\" Happening that the scientist causes damage to a specific location in the brain, the rat fails to do this vocalization and the game becomes a serious fight. Without laughter, the other thinks that he is being attacked. What sets us apart from animals is that we don't just have this basic mechanism. We have another more evolved. Animals have a sense of play, like us, but they have no sense of humor. The cortex, the surface part of their brain, is not as evolved as ours. We have cortical mechanisms that allow us, for example, to interpret a joke.\nTextual cohesion is responsible for establishing relationships between the parts of the text. Analyzing the excerpt “happening that the scientist causes damage to a specific location in the brain”, it is found that he establishes with the next prayer a relationship of\nA) Farm, because the damage caused to the brain has the purpose of provoking the lack of vocalization of the rats.\nB) Opposition, since the damage caused in a specific location in the brain is contrary to the vocalization of rats.\nC) Condition, as it is necessary to have a specific injury to the brain so that there is no vocalization of the rats.\nD) consequence, since the reason for no more vocalization of rats is the damage caused in the brain.\nE) proportion, as as the brain is injured, it is no longer possible for rats to vocalize."
