  "text": "Question 119) In its laboratory, a chemistry technician was tasked with treating a residue, avoiding its direct disposal in the environment. Upon finding the bottle, he observed the following information: \"Residue: mixture of ethyl acetate and water.\"\nConsider the ethyl acetate data: • Low water solubility; • Specific mass = 0.9 g cm - 3; • melting temperature = −83 ° C; • Vapor pressure higher than water.\nIn order to treat the waste, recovering the ethyl acetate, the technician must\nA) Evapor the ethyl acetate without changing the water content.\nB) Filter the mixture using a common funnel and a filter paper.\nC) perform a simple distillation to separate water from the ethyl acetate.\nD) proceed to a mixture centrifugation to remove the ethyl acetate.\nE) decant the mixture separating the two components into a suitable funnel."
