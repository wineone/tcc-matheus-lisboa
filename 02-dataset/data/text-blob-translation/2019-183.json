  "text": "Question 178) A construction company intends to connect a central reservoir (RC) in a cylinder shape, with an internal radius of 2 m and inner height equal to 3.30 m, four auxiliary cylindrical reservoirs (R1, R2, R3 and R4), which have internal rays and internal heights measuring 1.5 m.\nR1 R3 R2 R2 R4 The connections between the central reservoir and assistants are made by 0.10 m inner diameter cylindrical pipes and 20 m in length, connected near the foundations of each reservoir. In the connection of each of these pipes to the central reservoir there are records that release or interrupt the flow of water.\nAt the time the central reservoir is full and the assistants are empty, the four records are opened and, after some time, the heights of the water columns in the reservoirs are equal, as soon as the water flow between them ceases, by the principle of the communicating vessels.\nThe measure, in the meter, of the heights of the water columns in the auxiliary reservoirs, after ceasing the flow of water between them, is\nA) 1.44.\nB) 1.16.\nC) 1.10.\nD) 1.00.\nE) 0.95."
