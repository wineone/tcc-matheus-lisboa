  "text": "Question 61) These days, we can say that virtually all human beings have ever heard at some point to talk about DNA and its role in the heredity of most organisms. However, it was not until 1952, a year before the DNA model description in double propeller by Watson and Crick, which was confirmed without a doubt that DNA is genetic material. In the article where Watson and Crick described the DNA molecule, they suggested a model of how this molecule should replicate. In 1958, Meselson and Stahl conducted experiments using nitrogen heavy isotopes that were incorporated into the nitrogenous bases to evaluate how the molecule replication would take place. From the results, confirmed the model suggested by Watson and Crick, whose basic premise was the rupture of hydrogen bridges between the nitrogenous bases.\nGRIFFiths, A. J. F. et al. Introduction to genetics. Rio de Janeiro: Guanabara Koogan, 2002.\nConsidering the structure of the DNA molecule and the position of hydrogen bridges in it, the experiments performed by Meselson and Stahl about the replication of this molecule led to the conclusion that\nA) DNA replication is conservative, that is, the double daughter tape is newly synthesized and the parental filament is conserved.\nB) DNA replication is dispersive, that is, daughters are newly synthesized and parental DNA in each of the tapes.\nC) Replication is semiconservative, that is, the daughters ribbons consist of a parental tape and a newly synthesized.\nD) DNA replication is conservative, that is, the daughters ribbons consist of parental DNA molecules.\nE) Replication is semiconservative, that is, the daughters ribbons consist of a mold tape and a coding tape."
