  "text": "QUESTION 9) It is possible to state that many idioms transmitted by regional culture have anonymous authors, however, some of them emerged as a result of very curious historical contexts. “This is a plague goat” is a good example of these buildings.\nTo understand this expression so repeated in the northeast of Brazil, it is necessary to look back at the 16th century. “Goat” refers to the way Portuguese navigators called the Indians. Already “Plague” would be linked to the issue of overcoming and resistance, or even an association with the devil. Thus, over the years, such an expression has been used to call any individual who is brave, or even insolent, since the expression may be positive or negative. By the way, who has not already been \"nhe-gém\" out there? The term, which usually has meaning of endless, monotonous or grumbling conversation, originates in Tupi-Guarani and \"Nhém\" means \"speaking.\"\nReading the text allows the reader to contact\nA) Records of the inventory of Brazilian Portuguese.\nB) justifications of the country's linguistic variety.\nC) Influences of the northeastern speech on language use.\nD) Explorations of speaking of a specific social group.\nE) Representations of the linguistic change of Portuguese."
