  "text": "Question 158) HPV is a sexually transmitted disease. A 98% effective vaccine was created to prevent HPV infection and thus reduce the number of people who will develop cervical cancer. A vaccination campaign was launched in 2014 by SUS, for a target audience of 11 to 13 years old. It is considered that, in an unnamer population, HPV affects 50% of this audience throughout its lives. In a certain municipality, the campaign coordinating team decided to vaccinate girls between 11 and 13 years old in sufficient quantity so that the probability of a girl in this age group, chosen at chance, develops this disease at most 5, 9%. There were five coverage proposals to reach this goal: Proposal I: Vaccination of 90% of the target audience.\nProposal II: vaccination of 55.8% of the target audience.\nProposal III: vaccination of 88.2% of the target audience.\nProposal IV: Vaccination of 49% of the target audience.\nProposal V: Vaccination of 95.9% of the target audience.\nTo reduce costs, the proposal chosen should also be the one that vaccinated as little as possible.\nThe proposal implemented was the number\nTHERE.\nB) II.\nC) III.\nD) IV.\nE) V."
