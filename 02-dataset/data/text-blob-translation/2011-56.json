  "text": "QUESTION 56) The operating manual of an electric guitar pickup presents the following text: This ordinary pickup is a coil, conductive wires wrapped around a permanent magnet. The magnetic field of the magnet induces the ordering of the magnetic poles on the guitar rope, which is close to it. Thus, when the rope is touched, the oscillations produce variations, with the same pattern, in the magnetic flow that crosses the coil. This induces an electric current in the coil, which is transmitted to the amplifier and hence to the speaker. A guitarist exchanged the original ropes of his guitar, which were made of steel for others made of nylon. Using these strings, the instrument -connected amplifier no longer emitted sound, because the nylon rope\nA) Isolates the passage of electric current from the coil to the speaker.\nB) It varies its length more intensely than with steel.\nC) presents a negligible magnetization under the action of the permanent magnet.\nD) induces electrical currents on the coil more intense than the captain's capacity.\nE) oscillates with a lower frequency than that can be perceived by the pickup."
