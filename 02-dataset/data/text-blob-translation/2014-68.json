  "text": "QUESTION 68) A device proposal capable of indicating the quality of gasoline sold in posts and, consequently, avoiding fraud, could use the concept of light refractive. In this sense, non -adulterated gasoline at room temperature has ratio between the sinos of the incident and refracted rays equal to 1.4. Thus, making the air beam from the air with a fixed angle and greater than zero, any modification at the refracted beam angle will indicate tampering in the fuel.\nIn a routine inspection, the test presented the value of 1.9. What was the behavior of the refracted radius?\nA) changed sense.\nB) suffered total reflection.\nC) reached the value of the limit angle.\nD) directed to the separation surface.\nE) approached normal to the separation surface."
