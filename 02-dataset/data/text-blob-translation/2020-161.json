  "text": "Question 156) The Zipf Law, named after the American linguist George Zipf, is an empirical law that relates the frequency (f) of a word in a given text to its ranking (R). It is given by f = a r b.\nThe ranking of the word is your position in ordering the words in order of frequency. That is, r = 1 for the most frequent word, r = 2 for the second most frequent word and so on. A and B are positive constant.\nDiping at: http://klein.sbm.org.br. Accessed on: 12 ago. 2020 (adatped).\nBased on the values ​​of x = log (r) and y = log (f), it is possible to estimate values ​​for A and B.\nIn the hypothetical case where the law is verified exactly, the relationship between Y and X is\nA) y = log to −b x\nB) y = log to x + log b\nC) y = ba - x log\nD) y =\nB) x log\nE) y = x b log"
