  "text": "Question 83) Increasing the efficiency of fuel burning of combustion engines and reducing their pollutant emissions is the goal of any engine manufacturer. It is also the focus of Brazilian research that involves experiments with plasma, the fourth state of matter and is present in the ignition process. The spark interaction emitted by the spark plug with fuel molecules generates the plasma that causes the explosion liberating energy which in turn makes the engine work.\nHowever, the search for the efficiency referenced in the text presents as a limiting factor\nA) The type of fuel, fossil, which they use. Being a non -renewable input, at some point it will be exhausted.\nB) One of the principles of thermodynamics, according to which the yield of a thermal machine never reaches the ideal.\nC) the cyclic functioning of all engines. Continuous repetition of movements requires that part of the energy is transferred to the next cycle.\nD) the inevitable friction forces between the pieces. Such forces cause continuous wear that over time leads any material to fatigue and rupture.\nE) the temperature at which they work. To reach the plasma, a temperature is required than the fusion of the steel with which the engines are made."
