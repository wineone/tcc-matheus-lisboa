  "text": "Question 17) It happened more than once: He abandoned me. Like all the others. The fifth. We had been together for over a year. It seemed that this time it would be forever. But no: he suddenly disappeared, without a trail. When I realized, I spent hours calling nonstop - but I just called it, called, and no one answered. And then I did what needed to be done: I blocked the line.\nThe truth is that no cell phone supports me. I've tried all the brands and operators, just to find that they are all the same: at the first opportunity, they give on the foot. The latter took advantage that I was distracted and did not get off the taxi with me. Or had he already jumped from my pocket the moment I embarked on the taxi? I hope so. After doing what he did, I want more, he has gone to the gutter. [...] If they were still away the way they arrived, that's fine. [...] But I already know what I'm going to do. On the way to the cell phone store, I will pass a stationery shop. On second thought, none of my papermates never abandoned me.\nFREIRE, R. Start over again. The State of S. Paulo, Nov 24 2006.\nIn this fragment, in order to attract the reader's attention and to establish a conductive wire of meaning, the author uses\nA) first person singular to print subjectivity to the report of another loving disappointment.\nB) Irony to address the relationship with cell phones in the age of highly disposable products.\nC) Phrases made in the presentation of stereotyped love situations to build the ambiance of the text.\nD) Breaking expectation as an argumentative strategy to hide information.\nE) Past time verbs to emphasize an approximation with the facts covered throughout the text."
