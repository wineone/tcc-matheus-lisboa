  "text": "Question 77) A consumer suspects that the supermarket scale is not correctly gauging the mass of the products. Upon arriving home, it decides to check if the scale was dislocated. For this, it uses a container provided with volumetric scale, containing 1.0 liter of water. It puts a portion of the vegetables that bought inside the container and notes that the water reaches the 1.5 liter mark and also that the portion will not be fully submerged, with 1 3 of its volume out of water. To complete the test, the consumer, with the help of the internet, finds that the density of the vegetables, in question, is half of the density of the water, where, Raga = 1 g cm3.\nIn the supermarket the balance registered the mass of the vegetable portion of 0.500 kg (half kilogram).\nConsidering that the method adopted has good accuracy, the consumer concluded that the balance was decalibrated and should have registered the mass of the vegetable portion equal to\nA) 0.073 kg.\nB) 0.167 kg.\nC) 0.250 kg.\nD) 0.375 kg.\nE) 0.750 kg."
