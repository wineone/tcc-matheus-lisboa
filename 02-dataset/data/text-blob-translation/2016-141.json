  "text": "Question 136) For a science fair, two rocket projectiles, A and B, are being built to be launched. The planning is that they are launched together, with the purpose of projectile B intercept the A when it reaches its maximum height. For this to happen, one of the projectiles will describe a satellite trajectory, while the other will describe a supposedly rectilinear trajectory. The graph shows the heights achieved by these projectiles as a function of time in the simulations performed.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Height (m) 0 4 8 12 16 20-4-8 âˆ’12 Time (s) based on these simulations, it was observed that the trajectory of projectile B should be changed so that the objective was achieved.\nTo achieve the goal, the angular coefficient of the line that represents the trajectory of B must\nA) decrease in 2 units.\nB) decrease in 4 units.\nC) increase in 2 units.\nD) increase in 4 units.\nE) increase in 8 units."
