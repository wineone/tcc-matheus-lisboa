  "text": "Question 77) Steel production involves heating iron ore, along with charcoal (carbon) and atmospheric air in a series of oxirreduction reactions. The product is called a clove iron and contains about 3.3% carbon. One way to eliminate excess carbon is oxidation from the heating of pure oxygen iron. The two main products formed are sweet steel (iron alloy with 0.3% remaining carbon) and carbon dioxide. The approximate molar masses of the carbon and oxygen elements are, respectively, 12 g/mol and 16 g/mol.\nConsidering that an oven was fed 2.5 tons of water iron, the mass of carbon dioxide formed in kilograms in the production of sweet steel, is closer to\nA) 28.\nB) 75.\nC) 175.\nD) 275.\nE) 303."
