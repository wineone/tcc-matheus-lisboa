Its calculation is made according to the rainwater level accumulated in 1 m², ie if the index is 10 mm, means that the height of the accumulated water level in an open tank, in the shape of a cube with 1 m² of base area, is 10 mm. In a region, after a strong storm, it was found that the amount of rain accumulated in a cylindrical can, with 300 mm radius and height 1 200 mm, was one third of its capacity.\nUse 3.0 as approach to π.\nThe rainfall index of the region, during the temporal period, in millimeters, is\nA) 10.8.\nB) 12.0.\nC) 32.4.\nD) 108.0.\nE) 324.0."
