  "text": "Question 51) In mid -2003, more than 20 people died in Brazil after ingested a barium sulfate suspension used as a contrast in radiological examinations. Barium sulfate is a very little soluble soluble in water, which does not even dissolve in the presence of acids. The deaths occurred because a pharmaceutical laboratory provided the product contaminated with barium carbonate, which is soluble in acid medium. A simple test to verify the existence of soluble barium ions could have avoided the tragedy. This test consists of treating the sample with aqueous HCl solution and, after filtering to separate the insoluble compounds of barium, the aqueous solution of H2SO4 over the fixed is added and is observed for 30 min.\nThe presence of soluble barium ions in the sample is indicated by\nA) heat release.\nB) change of color to pink.\nC) precipitation of a white solid.\nD) Hydrogen gas formation.\nE) chlorine gas volatilization."
