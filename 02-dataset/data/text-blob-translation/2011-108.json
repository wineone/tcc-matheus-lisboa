  "text": "Question 103) Hypertext refers to non-sequential and non-linear electronic scripture, which forms and allows the reader to access a virtually unlimited number of other texts from local and successive, in real time. Thus, the reader is able to interactively define the flow of their reading from subjects dealt with in the text without being attached to a fixed sequence or to topics established by an author. It is a form of textual structuring that makes the reader simultaneously co-author of the final text. Hypertext is therefore characterized as a multilinearized, multisequential and indeterminate scripture/reading process, performed in a new writing space. Thus, by allowing various levels of treatment of a theme, hypertext offers the possibility of multiple degrees of depth simultaneously, as it has no definite sequence, but connects texts not necessarily correlated.\nThe computer has changed our way of reading and writing, and hypertext can be considered as a new space for writing and reading. Defined as a set of autonomous text blocks, presented in a computerized electronic medium and in which there are remissions associating various elements, hypertext\nA) It is a strategy that, by enabling fully open ways, disadvantages the reader, confusing the traditionally crystallized concepts.\nB) It is an artificial form of writing production, which, by diverting the focus of reading, may result in the disregard for traditional writing.\nC) requires the reader a greater degree of previous knowledge, so it should be avoided by students in their school research.\nD) facilitates research as it provides specific, secure and true information on any search or blog site offered on the internet.\nE) enables the reader to choose their own reading path, without following predetermined sequence, constituting more collective and collaborative activity."
