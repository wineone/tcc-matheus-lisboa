  "text": "Question 32) In 1879, about five thousand people gathered to request D. Pedro II the revocation of a rate of 20 réis, a vintém, on urban transport. Vintém was the lowest value currency at the time. Police did not allow the crowd to approach the palace. At the cry of “Outside Vintém!” The protesters beat drivers, stabbed mules, turned trams and ripped tracks. An officer ordered fire against the crowd. The statistics of dead and wounded are inaccurate. Many interests have merged into this revolt, large and politicians, girls and simple citizens. Decrealized, the ministry fell. A great social explosion, detonated by a poor vintém.\nThe reading of the stretch indicates that the violent restraint of the demonstrations represented an attempt to\nA) Capture radical activists.\nB) Protect private assets.\nC) safeguard the public space.\nD) conserve the exercise of power.\nE) support the democratic regime."
