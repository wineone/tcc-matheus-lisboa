  "text": "Question 60) Activated charcoal is a material that has a high carbon content, being widely used for the removal of volatile organic compounds from the middle, such as benzene. For the removal of these compounds, adsorption is used. This phenomenon occurs through interactions of the intermolecular type between the coal surface (adsorbent) and benzene (adsorbate, adsorbed substance).\nIn the case presented, between the adsorbent and the adsorbed substance, the formation of:\nA) Disulfide bonds.\nB) Covalent bonds.\nC) hydrogen bonds.\nD) Invuated dipole interactions - Induced dipole.\nE) Permanent dipole interactions - permanent dipole."
