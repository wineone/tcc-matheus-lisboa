Because of this, this sector is the largest oil consumer in the world, with high growth rates over time. While other sectors have obtained good results in reducing consumption, transportation tends to further concentrate the use of oil derivatives.\nAn environmental impact of technology more employed by the transport sector and a measure to promote the reduction of its use are indicated, respectively, in:\nA) Increased noise pollution - construction of acoustic barriers.\nB) Incidence of acid rain - nationalization of the auto industry.\nC) Melting of polar hubcaps - incentive for mass transport.\nD) propagation of respiratory diseases - distribution of free medicines.\nE) elevation of average temperatures - criminalization of carbon dioxide emission."
