What a forest! Nature, here, perpetually in celebration, is a bosom of a mother overflowing with affection.\nSee that life is on the floor! See that life is in the nests, shaking in the air, among the restless branches! See that light, what a hot, what a multitude of insects! See what a great length of forests, where it reigns, fruitful and luminous, the eternal spring! Good land! Never denied those who work the bread that kills hunger, the ceiling that wrap ...\nWho with his sweat fertil and moistens, sees his effort, and is happy, and enriches! Child! You will not see any country like this: imitates in the greatness of the land where you were born! BILAC, O. Children's poetry.
