  "text": "Question 155) The supply and demand curves of a product represent, respectively, the quantities that sellers and consumers are willing to market depending on the price of the product. In some cases, these curves may be represented by straight lines. Suppose the quantities of supply and demand for a product are, respectively, represented by the equations: Qo = â€“20 + 4p qd = 46 - 2p where it is the amount of offer, qd is the amount of demand and p is the price of product.\nFrom these equations, supply and demand, economists find the market equilibrium price, that is, when Qo and QD are equal.\nFor the situation described, what is the value of the equilibrium price?\nA) 5\nB) 11\nC) 13\nD) 23\nE) 33"
