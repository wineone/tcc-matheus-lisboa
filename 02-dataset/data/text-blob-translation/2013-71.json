  "text": "Question 71) Varfarin is a drug that decreases platelet aggregation, and is therefore used as anticoagulant, provided it is present in the plasma, with a concentration of more than 1.0 mg/l. However, plasma concentrations greater than 4.0 mg/l may trigger bleeding. The molecules of this drug are retained in intravascular space and dissolved exclusively in plasma, which represents approximately 60% of the blood in volume. In a medicine, varfarin is administered intravenously in the form of aqueous solution, with a concentration of 3.0 mg/ml. An adult individual, with a total blood volume of 5.0 L, will be underwent treatment with injectable solution of this medicine.\nWhat is the maximum volume of the solution of the drug that can be administered to this individual, intravenously, so that there is no bleeding caused by the anticoagulant?\nA) 1.0 ml\nB) 1.7 ml\nC) 2.7 ml\nD) 4.0 ml\nE) 6.7 ml"
