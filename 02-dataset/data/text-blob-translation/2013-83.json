  "text": "Question 83) Measuring temperature is critical in many applications, and presenting reading in digital dials is quite practical. Its operation is based on the correspondence between temperature values ​​and electrical potential difference. For example, we can use the electrical circuit presented, in which the temperature sensor element occupies one of the arms of the circuit (RS) and the dependence of resistance with the temperature is known.\n+ 10 v 470 Ω 470 Ω rs = 100 Ω 120 Ω voltmeter for a temperature value in which rs = 100 Ω, the reading presented by the voltmeter will be\nA) + 6.2 V.\nB) + 1.7 V.\nC) + 0.3 V.\nD) - 0.3 V.\nE) - 6.2 V."
