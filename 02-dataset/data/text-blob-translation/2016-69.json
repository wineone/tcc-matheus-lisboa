  "text": "Question 69) Recently a study of wheat fields showed that high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere impair nitrate absorption by plants. Consequently, the nutritional quality of these foods can decrease as carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere reach estimates for the coming decades.\nBLOOM, A. J. et al. NITRATE ASSIMILATION IS INHIBITED BY ELEVATED CO2 INFED-GRown Wheat. In this context, the nutritional quality of wheat grain will be modified primarily for the reduction of\nA) starch.\nB) fructose.\nC) lipids.\nD) Cellulose.\nE) proteins."
