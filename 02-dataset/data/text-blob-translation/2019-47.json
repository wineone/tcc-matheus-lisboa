  "text": "QUESTION 42) The science of Spider-Man many of the beloved man's superpowers-actually resemble the biological skills of spiders and are the object of study for the production of new materials.\nThe \"Spider-meaning\" acquired by Peter Parker works almost as a sixth sense, a kind of premonitory skill and therefore sounds like a fictional element. However, spiders really have a sharper sense. In fact, they have one of the most impressive sensory systems of nature.\nThe sensory hair of spiders, which are spread all over the body, function as a very good way to perceive the world and capture environmental information. In many species, this tact through the hair plays a more important role than the vision itself, since many spiders can arrest and attack their prey in complete darkness. And why are humans not as efficient as sensory organs like spiders? First, because a human being has an average of 60 hair wires in each cm² of the body, while some spider species can have 40 thousand hair per cm²; Second, because each spiders have up to 3 nerves to communicate between the perceived sensation and the brain, while we humans have only 1 nerve by hair.\nAs a strategy of progression of the text, the author simulates a dialogue with the reader public when resorting to\nA) Revelation of the “spider-meaning” acquired by the super-hero as a sixth sense.\nB) Characterization of the public affection by the superhero marked by the word “beloved”.\nC) Comparison between the powers of the superhero and the biological skills of spiders.\nD) Rhetorical question in the introduction of the causes of efficiency of the spiders sensory system.\nE) proof of differences between the physical constitution of man and spider through numerical data."
