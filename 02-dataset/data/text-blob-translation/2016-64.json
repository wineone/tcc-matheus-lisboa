  "text": "Question 64) Text I FUEL BIOCELLAs are a technological alternative to replace conventional batteries. In a microbiological biochell, bacteria catalyzes oxidation reactions of organic substrates. They release electrons produced in cellular respiration to an electrode, where they flow through an external circuit to the system cathode, producing electric current. A typical reaction that occurs in microbiological biochell uses acetate as a substrate.\nAQUINO NETO, S. Preparation and characterization of bioanodes for fuel biochell Text II in bioelectrochemical systems, the standard (and ° ') potentials have characteristic values. For acetate biocells, consider the following semi -reducing semi -strokes and their respective potentials: 2 CO2 + 7 h + + 8 e - → CH3COO - + 2 H2O and ° '= −0.3 V O2 + 4 H + + 4 E− → → 2 H2O E ° '= 0.8 V Scott, K.; YU, E. H. Microbial Electrochemical and Fuel Cells: Fundamentals and Under these conditions, what is the minimum number of acetate biochélulas, linked in series, needed to get a 4.4 V potential difference?\nA) 3\nB) 4\nC) 6\nD) 9\nE) 15"
