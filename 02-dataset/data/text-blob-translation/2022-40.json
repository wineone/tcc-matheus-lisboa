  "text": "Question 35) Being a chronicler I know I am not, but I have meditated slightly on the subject.\nIs chronic a report? Is it a conversation? Is it a summary of a state of mind? I don't know, because before I started writing for Jornal do Brasil, I had only written novels and short stories.\nAnd also without realizing it, as I wrote here, I was becoming too personal, at the risk of soon publishing my past and present life, which I do not intend. Another thing I noticed: I just know that I'm writing for the newspaper, that is, for something easily open all over the world, not for a book, which is only opened by those who really want, so that without even feeling, the way of writing becomes. It is not that it displeases me to change, on the contrary. But I wanted to be deeper and more inner changes that would not be reflected in writing. But change just because this is a column or a chronicle? Being lighter just because the reader wants it? Have fun? Make a few minutes of reading? And another thing: In my books I want deep communication with me and the reader. Here in the newspaper I only talk to the reader and pleases me that he is pleased. I'll tell you the truth: I'm not happy.\nLISPECTOR, C. In: The Discovery of the World. Rio de Janeiro: Rocco, 1999.\nIn the text, in reflecting on the activity of the chronicler, the author questions characteristics of the chronic genre, as\nA) Distance relationship between the interlocutors.\nB) Articulation of various narrative nuclei.\nC) brevity in the treatment of the theme.\nD) thorough description of the characters.\nE) Exclusive reading audience."
