We are only known for our slowness. The trail we will leave in history will be as despicable as the asty that marks our passage through the floors.\nTo this frustration corresponded to a dream: the slug wanted to be like that distant relative, the escargot. The simple name was already fascinated: a French, elegant, sophisticated term, a term that people pronounced with respect and even admiration.

This argument did not convince the dissatisfied slug, on the contrary: it would rather finish finishing your life in this way, on a table of adamasted towel, between silver cutlery and crystal cups. Just as the sea is the only tomb worthy of an Admiral Batavo, he answered, the porcelain platter is the only designer of my dreams.\nScliar, M. Lesma Dream. In: Abreu, C. F. et al.
