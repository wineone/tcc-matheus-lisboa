  "text": "QUESTION 77) We see that every city is a kind of community, and every community forms with a view to some good, for all the actions of all men are practiced with a view to what seems like a good; If all communities are aimed at some good, it is evident that the most important of them and includes all others has more than all this goal and aims at the most important of all goods. Aristotle. Policy. Brasilia: UnB, 1988.\nIn the fragment, Aristotle promotes a reflection that associates two elements essential to the discussion about community life, namely:\nA) ethics and political, because they lead to eudaimonia.\nB) rhetoric and language, because they take care of discourses in the agora.\nC) metaphysics and ontology, because they deal with first philosophy.\nD) democracy and society, because they refer to social relations.\nE) Generation and corruption, as they embrace the Physis field."
