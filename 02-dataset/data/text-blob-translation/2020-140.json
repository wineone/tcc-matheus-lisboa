  "text": "Question 135) The EI ï¬€ El, with its 324 meters high, made with iron trusses, weighed 7 300 tons when it was finished in 1889. An architect decides to build a prototype of this 1: 100 scale tower, using them Materials (each linear dimension on a scale of 1: 100 of the real monument). Consider that the royal tower has a morre mass and exerts on the foundation on which a PTORRE pressure was erected. The model built by the architect will have a mmodel mass and will exert a pmodel pressure.\nHow is the pressure exerted by the tower compared to the pressure exerted by the prototype? That is, what is the ratio between the pressures (PTORRE)/(pmodel)?\nA) 100\nB) 101\nC) 102\nD) 104\nE) 106"
