  "text": "Question 173) Portuguese designer Miguel Neiva created a symbol system that allows colorblows to identify colors. The system consists of the use of symbols that identify primary colors (blue, yellow and red). In addition, the juxtaposition of two of these symbols allows you to identify secondary colors (such as green, which is the yellow combined with blue). Black and white are identified by small squares: what symbolizes black is full, while what symbolizes white is empty. The symbols that represent black and white may also be associated with symbols that identify colors, meaning whether they are clear or dark.\nAccording to the text, how many colors can be represented by the proposed system?\nA) 14\nB) 18\nC) 20\nD) 21\nE) 23"
