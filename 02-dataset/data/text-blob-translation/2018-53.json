  "text": "Question 48) The tribe does not have a king, but a boss who is not head of state. What does that mean? Simply that the boss does not have any authority, any power of coercion, any means of giving an order. The boss is not a commander, the tribe's people have no duty of obedience. The space of leadership is not the place of power. Essentially in charge of eliminating conflicts that may arise between individuals, families and lineages, the boss only has, to restore order and concord, the prestige that recognizes him to society. But evidently prestige does not mean power, and the means that the boss holds to accomplish his task as a peacemaker are limited to the exclusive use of the word.\nCLASTRES, P. Society against the State. The political model of societies discussed in the text contrasts with that of the bourgeois liberal state because it is based on:\nA) Ideological imposition and hierarchical norms.\nB) Divine determination and monarchical sovereignty.\nC) consensual intervention and community autonomy.\nD) Legal mediation and contractual rules.\nE) collective management and tax obligations."
