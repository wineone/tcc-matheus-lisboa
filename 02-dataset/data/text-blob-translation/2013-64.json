  "text": "Question 64) One of the steps of water treatment is disinfection, and chlorination is the most employed method. This method consists of the dissolution of chlorine gas in a solution under pressure and its application in the water to be disinfected. The equations of the chemical reactions involved are: Cl2 (g) + 2 H2O (L) Hclo (aq) + H3O + (aq) + Cl− (aq) HClo (aq) + H2O (L) H3O + (aq) + clo− ( aq) pka = - log ka = 7.53 The disinfectant action is controlled by hypochlorous acid, which has a disinfection potential about 80 times higher than hypochlorite anion. The pH of the environment is important because it influences the extent to which hypochlorous acid is ionize.\nSo that disinfection is more effective, the pH of the water to be treated must be closer to\nA) 0.\nB) 5.\nC) 7.\nD) 9.\nE) 14."
