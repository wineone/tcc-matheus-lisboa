[…] That's why Hideo required that on Sundays everyone was together during lunch. He sat at the head of the table; On the right, Hanashiro, who was the first son, and Hitoshi, the second, and on the left, Haruo, then Hiroshi, who was the youngest. […] The wife, who was also a mother, and the philhas, who were also sisters, were waiting around the table […]. Haruo complained, not tired of complaining: that the women also felt at the table, which was absurd that custom. When they married, their wife and husband would sit at the table in front of each other, because he was not the better man than the woman to be the first […]. They followed up, the mother a little tired of the son protests, because the moment of lunch was sacred, it was not time to raise useless flags […].\nNAKASATO, O. Nihonjin.
