  "text": "Question 116) It is water that no longer ends preliminary data released by researchers from the Federal University of Pará (UFPA) pointed to the Alter do Chão aquifer as the largest drinking water deposit on the planet. With estimated volume of 86,000 cubic kilometers of freshwater, the underground reserve is located under the states of Amazonas, Pará and Amapá. \"This amount of water would be sufficient to supply the world population for 500 years,\" says Milton Matta, a UFPA geologist. In comparative terms, Alter do Chão is almost double the volume of water from the Guarani aquifer (with 45,000 cubic kilometers). Until then, Guarani was the largest underground reserve in the world, distributed by Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.\nEra.
