  "text": "Question 176) Ceramics has the property of contraction, which consists of evaporation of water in a set or ceramic block subjected to a certain high temperature: in its place appearing “empty spaces” that tend to approach. In the place previously occupied by the water, they get gaps and, consequently, the set tends to retract. Consider that in the cooking process the clay ceramic suffers a linear contraction of 20%.\nTaking into account the cooking process and contraction suffered, volume V of a clay platter, cubicly of edge A, decreases to a value that is\nA) 20% lower than V, since the cube volume is directly proportional to the length on its side.\nB) 36% less than V, because the base area decreases from A2 to (1 - 0.2) a) 2.\nC) 48.8% less than V, because the volume decreases from A3 to (0.8a) 3.\nD) 51.2% less than V, because each side decreases to 80% of the original length.\nE) 60% lower than V, because each side decreases 20%."
