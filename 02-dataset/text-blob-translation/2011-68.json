  "text": "Question 68) An US Research Institute recently announced that it created a “synthetic cell”, a bacteria called MyCoplasma Mycoides. The researchers set up a sequence of nucleotides, which form the only chromosome of this bacteria, which was introduced in another species of bacteria, mycoplasma capricolum. After the introduction, the M. Capricolum chromosome was neutralized and the M. Mycoides artificial chromosome began to manage the cell by producing its proteins. Gilbson et al. Creation of a bacterial Cell Controlled by a Chemilly Synthesized Genome. The importance of this technological innovation for the scientific community is due to\nA) Possibility to sequence bacteria genomes to be used as receptors of artificial chromosomes.\nB) Creation capacity for science of new life forms using substances such as carbohydrates and lipids.\nC) Possibility of mass production of mycoplasma bacteria capricolum for its distribution in natural environments.\nD) possibility of genetically programming microorganisms or more complex beings to produce medications, vaccines and fuels.\nE) Capricolum mycoplasma bacteria capacity to express their proteins in synthetic bacteria and are used in the industry."
