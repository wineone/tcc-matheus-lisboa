  "text": "Question 51) To prevent microbial contamination of water supply, the effluent emissions must be eliminated and, when necessary, treat it with disinfectant. Hypoclorous acid (HCLO), produced by the reaction between chlorine and water, is one of the most employed compounds as a disinfectant. However, it does not only act as oxidizing, but also as an active chlorination agent. The presence of dissolved organic matter in chlorinated water supply may lead to chloroform formation (CHCL3) and other toxic chlorinated organic species.\nSPIRO, T. G.; STIGLIANI, W. M. Environmental Chemistry. In order to eliminate chloroform and other organic molecules from water, proper treatment is the\nA) filtration, using active charcoal filters.\nB) Fluoride, by the addition of sodium fluoride.\nC) coagulation, by the addition of aluminum sulfate.\nD) pH correction by the addition of sodium carbonate.\nE) flocculation, in concrete tanks with moving water."
