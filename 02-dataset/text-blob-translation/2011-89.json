  "text": "Question 88) Certain algae species are able to quickly absorb inorganic compounds present in water, accumulating them during their growth. This ability has been thinking of using them as biofilters for the cleaning of contaminated aquatic environments, removing, for example, nitrogen and phosphorus of organic waste and heavy metals from industrial tailings thrown into the water. In the technique of integrated cultivation, animals and algae grow in an associated way, promoting greater ecological balance. SORIANO, E. M. Living filters to clean the water. The use of the integrated cultivation technique of animals and algae represents a proposal favorable to a more balanced ecosystem because\nA) Animals eliminate heavy metals, which are used by algae for biomass synthesis.\nB) Animals provide nitrogen organic excreta, which are transformed into carbon dioxide by algae.\nC) Algae use nitrogen residues released by animals and eliminate carbon dioxide in photosynthesis used in aerobic respiration.\nD) Algae use nitrogenous waste from animal metabolism and, during the synthesis of organic compounds, release oxygen to the environment.\nE) Algae take advantage of the residues of animal metabolism and, during chemosynthesis of organic compounds, release oxygen to the environment."
