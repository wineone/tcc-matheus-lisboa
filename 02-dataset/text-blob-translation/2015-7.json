  "text": "Question 07) The main articulator of the current Chinese economic model argues that the market is only an economic instrument, which is indistinctly employed in both capitalism and socialism. But the Chinese themselves are already feeling, in their society, their real meaning: the market is not something neutral, or a technical instrument that enables society to use it for the construction and building of socialism. It is, contrary to what the articulator says, an instrument of capitalism and is inherent in its structure as a mode of production. Its use is leading to a polarization of Chinese society.\nIn the text, the economic reforms that occurred in China are placed as antagonistic to the construction of a socialist country. In this context, the fundamental characteristic of socialism, to which the current Chinese economic model is opposed is the\nA) privatization of the economy.\nB) establishment of a single party.\nC) Maintenance of free competition.\nD) Training of labor unions.\nE) gradual extinction of social classes."
