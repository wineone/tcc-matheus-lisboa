This generator has a key that can be connected to positions A or B.\n+ - 1 2 3 Considering the operation of the given circuit, the lamp 1 will shine more when the key is in position\nA) B, because the current will be higher in this case.\nB) b, because the total power will be greater in this case.\nC) a, because the equivalent resistance will be lower in this case.\nD) b, as the generator will provide greater voltage in this case.\nE) a, since the power dissipated by the generator will be lower in this case."
