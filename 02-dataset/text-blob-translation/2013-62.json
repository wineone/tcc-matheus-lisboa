  "text": "Question 62) The strategy of obtaining transgenic plants by inserting transgens in chloroplasts, replacing the classic transgender insertion methodology into the host cell core, resulted in the quantitative increase in the production of recombinant proteins with various biotechnological purposes. The same type of strategy could be used to produce recombinant proteins in non -photosynthetic eukaryotic organism cells, such as yeast, which are used for commercial production of various recombinant proteins that can be grown in large fermentants.\nConsidering the methodological strategy described, which cell organela could be used to insert transgens in yeast?\nA) lysosome.\nB) mitochondria.\nC) Peroxisome.\nD) Golgiense complex.\nE) endoplasmic reticulum."
