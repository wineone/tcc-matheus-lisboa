  "text": "Question 93) In a frontal collision between two cars, the force that the seat belt exerts on the driver's chest and abdomen can cause serious injuries to the internal organs. Thinking about the safety of your product, a car manufacturer has performed tests on five different belt models. The tests simulated a collision of 0.30 second, and the dolls representing the occupants were equipped with accelerometers. This equipment records the doll's slowdown module as a function of time. The parameters such as doll mass, belt dimensions and speed immediately before and after impact were the same for all tests. The final result obtained is the acceleration graph for time.\n200 160 120 80 40 0 ​​Acceleration (m/s2) 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 Time (s) 0.20 0.25 0.30 belt 1 belt 2 belt 3 belt 4 belt 5 which model 5 Belt offers lower risk of internal driver injury?\nTO 1\nB) 2\nC) 3\nD) 4\nE) 5"
