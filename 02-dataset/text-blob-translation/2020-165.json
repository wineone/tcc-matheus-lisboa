  "text": "Question 160) Suppose a car race team has five types of tire (I, II, III, IV, V), where the EC climate efficiency factor (index that provides the behavior of the tire in use, depending on the Climate) is presented: • Tire I: with rain 6, no rain 3; • Tire EC II: with rain 7, without rain −4; • Tire EC III: with rain −2, no rain 10; • Tire EC IV: with rain 2, no rain 8; • Tire EC V: With rain −6, no rain 7.\nThe climate performance coefficient (CRC) of a tire is calculated as the sum of the products of EC factors, with or without rain, due to the probability of having such weather conditions: it is used to determine which tire should be selected for one Given race, choosing the tire that presents the largest CRC that day. On the day of a certain race, the likelihood of raining was 70% and the team chief calculated the CRC of each of the five types of tire.\nThe chosen tire was\nTHERE.\nB) II.\nC) III.\nD) IV.\nE) V."
