  "text": "Question 75) Did a mirage help sink Titanic? The optical phenomenon known as FATA Morgana can cause a false wall of water to appear on the wet horizon. When conditions are favorable, light reflected by cold water can be diverted by an unusual layer of hot air above, coming to the observer from many different angles. According to studies by researchers at the University of San Diego, a FATA Morgana may have obscured the icebergs of the view of the crew that was aboard the Titanic. Thus, at a certain distance, the true horizon is covered by a darkened mist, which looks a lot of calm waters in the dark.\nThe optical phenomenon that, according to the researchers, provokes FATA Morgana is the\nA) Resonance.\nB) refraction.\nC) diffraction.\nD) reflection.\nE) diffusion."
