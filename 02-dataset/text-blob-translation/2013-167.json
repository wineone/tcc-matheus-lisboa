  "text": "Question 162) In September 1987, Goiânia was the scene of the largest radioactive accident in Brazil, when a sample of cesium-137, removed from an abandoned radiotherapy device, was inadvertently manipulated by the population. The half-life of a radioactive material is the time required for the mass of this material to be halved. The cesium-137 half-life is 30 years and the remaining amount of mass of a radioactive material, after t years, is calculated by the expression m (t) = a · (2.7) kt, where A is the initial mass and k is a negative constant.\nConsider 0.3 as approach to log10 2.\nWhat time is the time in years, so that a mass of cesium-137 is reduced to 10% of the initial amount?\nA) 27\nB) 36\nC) 50\nD) 54\nE) 100"
