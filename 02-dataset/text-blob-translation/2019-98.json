  "text": "Question 93) In 1808, Dalton published his famous book entitled A New Chemical Philosophy System (from the original to New System of Chemical Philosophy), which contained the five postulates that served as the foundation of the first atomic theory of matter based on the scientific method . These postulates are numbered below: 1. Matter consists of indivisible atoms.\n2. All atoms of a given chemical element are identical in mass and in all other properties.\n3. Different chemical elements have different types of atoms; In particular, their atoms have different masses.\n4. Atoms are indestructible and in chemical reactions maintain their identities.\n5. Atoms of elements combine with atoms of other elements in proportions of small integers to form compounds.\nAfter Dalton's model, other models based on other experimental data showed, among other things, the electrical nature of matter, composition and organization of the atom and the quantization of energy in the atomic model.\nOXTOBY, D.
