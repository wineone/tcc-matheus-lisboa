  "text": "Question 30) Text I Our struggle is for the democratization of land ownership, increasingly concentrated in our country. About 1% of all owners control 46% of land. We put pressure on the occupation of unproductive estates and large properties, which do not comply with social function, as determined by the 1988 Constitution. We also occupy the farms that originate in the land grabbing of public lands.\nText II The small rural owner is equal to a small store owner: the lower the business the more difficult to maintain, because it has to be productive and the charges are difficult to afford.

Supporting a productive company that generates employment is much cheaper and generates much more than supporting land reform.\nIn the fragments of texts, the positions in relation to land reform oppose.
