From there, the computer created the text by combining the sentences and following the guidelines that scientists imposed. Judges do not know which texts are written by humans and which are made by computers, which shows that the tale was well written. The day just did not move to the next steps because, according to the judges, the characters were not very well described, although the text was structurally impeccable.\nThe idea of ​​scientists is to continue developing AI's creativity so that it seems more and more with human. Simulating this type of answer is difficult, because the computer must first have a vast database linked to a specific program for each type of project - writing, painting, music, drawing and so on.\nAccessed on: 5 Dec. 2018.\nThe success and limitations of the technology used in the composition of the tale show the\nA) indistinction between characters produced by machines and humans.\nB) Need for reformulation of the database elaborated by scientists.\nC) autonomy of computational programs in fictional development.\nD) difference between the structure and creativity of human language.\nE) artistic quality of texts produced by computers."
