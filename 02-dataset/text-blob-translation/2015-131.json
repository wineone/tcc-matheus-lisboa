  "text": "Question 126) In 1985 a very serious accident happened in Angra dos Reis, Rio de Janeiro, near the Guarani village of Sapukai. It rained a lot and the rainwater caused lands of land from the slopes of the Serra do Mar, destroying the radio ecology laboratory of the nuclear central Almirante Álvaro Alberto, built in 1970 in a place that the Tupinambás Indians, over 500 years ago, called Itaorna. The damage was calculated at the time in 8 billion cruises. The engineers responsible for the construction of the nuclear plant did not know that the name given by the Indians contained information about the soil structure, undermined by the rainwater. They only found that Itaorna, in Tupinambá language, means 'rotten stone' after the accident.\nConsidering the history of occupation in the region of Angra dos Reis mentioned in the text, the natural phenomena that hit it could have been foreseen and its minimized consequences if\nA) The indigenous linguistic collection was known and valued.\nB) Brazilian indigenous languages ​​had been replaced by the general language.\nC) Academic knowledge had been prioritized by the engineers.\nD) The Tupinambá language had adequate words to describe the soil.\nE) the laboratory had been built according to the environmental laws in force at the time."
