  "text": "Question 55) Would things seem different if, in fact, they all existed only in your mind - if all you thought was the real external world were just a giant dream or hallucination that you would never awaken? If so, then of course you could never wake up, as you do when you dream, it would mean that there is no \"real\" world in which you wake up. Therefore, it would not be exactly the same as a normal dream or hallucination.\nNAGEL, T. A brief introduction to philosophy. SÃ£o Paulo: Martins Fontes, 2011.\nThe text gives visibility to a contemporary philosophical doctrine known as:\nA) Personalism, which binds the reality surrounding to the domains of the personnel.\nB) falsificationism, which establishes problems of problems to refute a conjecture.\nC) Falibilism, which rejects mental mechanisms to support an unambiguous belief.\nD) Idealism, which denies the existence of objects regardless of the cognoscent work.\nE) solipsism, which recognizes cognitive limitations to understand a shared experience."
