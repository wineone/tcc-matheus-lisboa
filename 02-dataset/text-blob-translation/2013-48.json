At the midpoint of the distance between the bottles, a incandescent lamp was kept on a few minutes. Then the lamp was turned off. During the experiment, the temperatures of the bottles were monitored: a) While the lamp remained on and b) after the lamp was turned off and reaching thermal balance with the environment.\nThermometer The rate of variation in the temperature of the black bottle compared to white, throughout the experiment, was\nA) equal in heating and equal in cooling.\nB) higher in heating and equal in cooling.\nC) lower in heating and equal in cooling.\nD) higher in heating and lower in cooling.\nE) higher in heating and higher in cooling."
