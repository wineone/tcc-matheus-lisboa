  "text": "Question 58) TEXT I In March 1889, when the first pilgrimages attracted by the miracles of the Blessed Maria de Araújo appeared, Juazeiro was inserted in the list of the foundation of the religious space. Another center was built, such as Aparecida do Norte, Canindé or Lourdes.\nRAMOS, F. R. L. The middle of the world: sacred territory in Juazeiro do Father Cicero. Fortaleza: University Press, 2014.\nText II We do not know for sure how many people were present in the chapel as the Host bled in the mouth of Maria de Araújo. Father Cicero tells us that the fact surprised not only to those present, but Batata herself seemed stunned by what happened. The phenomenon continued to happen every Wednesday and Fridays in the chapel of Our Lady of Sorrows from that day. The spotted bloodstains of the Blood that drained from the Host and the Blessed Boca, at first, were under the guard of Father Cicero, but were soon exposed to public visitation and, besides, the bleeding was proclaimed as miracle without knowledge and without Authorization of the Diocesan Bishop.\nThe religious practices mentioned in the texts are associated, respectively, with:\nA) Delimitation of urban landscapes and abandonment of spiritualist components.\nB) Demarcation of affective heritage and appropriation of Judaizing elements.\nC) Expansion of regional boundaries and subjectivation of medieval Christianity.\nD) Circumscription of symbolic goods and admission of ecumenical ceremonies.\nE) Creation of mystical places and experiences of popular Catholicism."
