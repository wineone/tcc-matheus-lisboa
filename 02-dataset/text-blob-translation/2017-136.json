  "text": "Question 131) Paper chromatography is a separation method that is based on the differential migration of the components of a mixture between two immiscible phases. Sample components are separated between the stationary phase and the moving mobile phase on paper. The stationary phase consists of practically pure cellulose, which can absorb up to 22% of water. It is the absorbed water that acts as a liquid stationary phase that interacts with the moving phase, also liquid (liquid liquid partition). The components capable of forming stronger intermolecular interactions with the stationary phase migrate more slowly.\nA 5% (V/V) hexan mixture of acetone was used as a mobile phase in the separation of components of a plant extract obtained from peppers. Consider that this extract contains the substances represented.\nγ-carotene α-critical oh capsorubine oh ho licopene α-carotene The substance present in the mixture that migrates most slowly is (a)\nA) Lycopene.\nB) α-carotene.\nC) γ-carotene.\nD) capsorubin.\nE) α-criptoxantine."
