  "text": "Question 174) In 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale caused a devastating tsunami in Japan, causing a warning at the Fukushima nuclear power plant. In 2013, another 7.0 magnitude earthquake on the same scale shook Sichuan (southwest China), leaving hundreds of dead and thousands of injuries. The magnitude of a richter scale earthquake can be calculated by m = 2 log (E) 3 and0, being and energy, in kWh, released by the earthquake and E0 a positive real constant. Consider that E1 and E2 represent the energies released in the earthquakes that occurred in Japan and China, respectively.\nWhat is the relationship between E1 and E2?\nA) E1 = E2 + 2\nB) E1 = 102. E2\nC) E1 = 103. E2\nD) E1 = 10 9 7. E2\nE) E1 = 9 7. E2"
