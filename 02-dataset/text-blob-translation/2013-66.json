  "text": "Question 66) To saw bones and frozen meats, a butcher uses a tape saw that has three pulleys and one engine. The equipment can be mounted in two different ways, P and Q. For safety reasons, the mountain must have lower linear speed.\nRibbon Sierra Mounting pgly 3 pulley 2 belt engine tape mounting q pulley 3 pulley 2 belt engine pulley 1 pulley 1 by which assembly the butcher should choose and what is the justification of this option?\nA) Q, because pulleys 1 and 3 rotate with equal linear speeds at peripheral points and the largest radius will have less frequency.\nB) Q, because pulleys 1 and 3 rotate with equal frequencies and the one with the highest radius will have lower linear speed at a peripheral point.\nC) p, because pulleys 2 and 3 rotate at different frequencies and the one with the highest radius will have lower linear speed at a peripheral point.\nD) p, because pulleys 1 and 2 rotate with different linear speeds at peripheral points and the lowest radius will have greater frequency.\nE) Q, because pulleys 2 and 3 rotate with different linear speeds at peripheral points and the one with the highest radius will have less frequency."
