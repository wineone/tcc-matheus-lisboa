  "text": "Question 46) Christiaan Huygens, in 1656, created the pendulum clock. In this device, punctuality is based on the regularity of small pendulum oscillations. To maintain the accuracy of this clock, several problems have been circumvented. For example, the rod underwent adjustments until, in the early twentieth century, there was an innovation, which was its manufacture using a metal alloy that behaves regularly in a wide temperature range.\nYODER, J. G. Unrolling Time: Christiaan Huygens and the Mathematization of Nature. Disregarding the presence of dissipative forces and considering the acceleration of constant gravity, so that this type of clock correctly performs the count count, it is necessary that the (A) must be\nA) length of the rod is kept constant.\nB) body mass suspended by the rod is small.\nC) Material of the rod has high thermal conductivity.\nD) amplitude of oscillation is constant at any temperature.\nE) Potential gravitational energy of the suspended body remains constant."
