  "text": "Question 108) Electronic devices that use low -cost materials such as semiconductor polymers have been developed to monitor ammonia concentration (toxic and colorless gas) in poultry farms. Polyaniline is a semiconductor polymer that has the value of its nominal electrical resistance quadrupled when exposed to high ammonia concentrations. In the absence of ammonia, polyaniline behaves like an ohmic resistor and its electrical response is shown on the graph.\nCurrent (10–6 a) potential difference (v) 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.5 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 O value of polyaniline electrical resistance in the presence of high ammonia concentrations, in OHM, is equal to\nA) 0.5 × 100.\nB) 2.0 × 100.\nC) 2.5 × 105.\nD) 5.0 × 105.\nE) 2.0 × 106."
