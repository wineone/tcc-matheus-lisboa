  "text": "Question 27) More big than Bang The world scientific community received last week the official confirmation of a discovery about which it was spoken with huge expectation a few months ago. Researchers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Astrophysics Center have revealed that they have obtained the strongest evidence so far that the universe we lived in the Big Bang, but this was no explosion, but a sudden expansion of infinite matter and energy concentrated at one point Microscopic that, without many semantic options, scientists call \"singularity.\" This cosmic seed remained in a latent state and, without still a definitive explanation, began to swell quickly [...]. At the break of a blink of an eye, for example, it would be possible, therefore, to occur more than 10 trillion Big Bangs.\nIn the title proposed for this text of scientific dissemination, in dissociating the elements of the expression Big Bang, the author reveals the intention of\nA) To highlight the recent discovery that proves the explosion of matter and energy.\nB) summarize the results of a research that brought evidence to the Big Bang theory.\nC) Synthesize the idea that the theory of expansion of matter and energy replaces the theory of explosion.\nD) highlight the experience that confirms an earlier investigation into the theory of matter and energy.\nE) condense the conclusion that the explosion of matter and energy occurs at a microscopic point."
