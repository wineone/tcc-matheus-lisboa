  "text": "QUESTION 57) The bat emits short -lived wave pulses, which return in the form of echoes after reaching objects in the environment, bringing information about their dimensions, their locations and their possible movements. This is due to the bat's sensitivity to detect the time spent for echoes to return, as well as the small variations in the frequencies and intensities of the ultrasonic pulse. These characteristics allow you to hunt small prey even when moving to you. Consider a one -dimensional situation in which a moth walks away, in rectilinear and uniform motion, of a bat at rest.\nThe distance and speed of the moth, in the situation described, would be detected by the system of a bat by what changes in the characteristics of the ultrasonic pulse?\nA) Decreased intensity, increased return time and decreased perceived frequency.\nB) Increased intensity, decreased return time and decreased perceived frequency.\nC) decreased intensity, decreased return time and increased perceived frequency.\nD) decreased intensity, increased return time and increased perceived frequency.\nE) Increased intensity, increased return time and increased perceived frequency."
