  "text": "Question 86) Osmosis is a spontaneous process that occurs in all living organisms and is essential to maintaining life. A 0.15 mol/L solution of NaCℓ (sodium chloride) has the same osmotic pressure as solutions present in human cells.\nThe immersion of a human cell in a 0.20 mol/L solution of NaCℓ has, as a result, the\nA) Na+ ion adsorption on the cell surface.\nB) rapid diffusion of Na+ ions into the cell.\nC) decreased concentration of solutions present in the cell.\nD) Transfer of Na+ ions from the cell to the solution.\nE) transfer of water molecules from the cell to the solution."
