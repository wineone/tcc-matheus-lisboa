  "text": "Question 08) Is it a redhead? Has blue eyes? Are you male or female? Do you wear hat? Those who played face to face in childhood know the script for questions to guess who is the mysterious character of his opponent.\nNow the game is about to win a new version. Is Polish designer Zuzia Kozerska-Girard developing a variation of Guess Who? (name from the face to face), in which the tray's personalities are actually notable women in history and today, such as artist Frida Kahlo, activist Malala Yousafzai, astronaut Valentina Tereshkova and aviaador Amelia Earhart. Who's She? (“Who is she?” In Portuguese) brings, in total, 28 women who represent various professions, nationalities and ages.\nThe idea is that instead of asking about the appearance of the characters, the questions are directed to their achievements: Did you get any Nobel, did you have any discovery? For each character there is a card with fun and interesting facts about their life. A campaign has aired with the purpose of raising money to develop Who's She? The initial goal was to gather $ 17,000. Eight days before the campaign is over, the project has raised almost $ 350,000.\nThe arrival of the game at the buyer's house varies according to the amount donated - the more you donated, the faster you can play.\nBy publicizing the adaptation of the game to issues related to actions and skills of remarkable women, the text seeks\nA) contribute to the citizen formation of the players.\nB) Refut stereotyped models of beauty and elegance.\nC) stimulate competitiveness between potential buyers.\nD) Exemplify financial collection strategies over the internet.\nE) Develop specific playful knowledge of the present times."
