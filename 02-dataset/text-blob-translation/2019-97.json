  "text": "Question 92) 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) is known as electron chain decoplator in mitochondria and has a weight loss effect. However, because it is dangerous and the occurrence of lethal cases, its use as a medicine is prohibited in several countries, including Brazil. In mitochondria, this substance captures, in the intermoban space, protons (H+) from the activity of respiratory chain proteins, returning them to the mitochondrial matrix. Thus, these protons do not undergo enzymatic transport in the inner membrane.\nGRANDLINGH, J. et al. 2,4-Dinitrophenol (DNP): A Weight Loss Agent with Significant Acute Toxicity and Risk of Death. The weight loss effect of this compound is related to the\nA) Respiratory chain obstruction, resulting in higher cellular consumption of fatty acids.\nB) block of Krebs cycle reactions, resulting in greater cellular energy expenditure.\nC) decreased production of acetyl coa, resulting in higher Pyruvate cellular expenditure.\nD) inhibition of glycolysis, resulting in greater cellular absorption of blood glucose.\nE) Reduction of ATP production, resulting in greater cellular nutrient expenditure."
