  "text": "QUESTION 30) TEXT I have experienced a few times that the senses were misleading, and it is of prudence never to come entirely to those who have already deceived us once.\nDescartes, R. Metaphysical meditations. SÃ£o Paulo: April Cultural, 1979.\nText II Whenever we feed some suspicion that an idea is being used without any meaning, we will only need to ask: What impression does this supposed idea derive? And if it is impossible to give you any sensory impression, this will serve to confirm our suspicion.\nIn texts, both authors position themselves over the nature of human knowledge. Comparison of excerpts allows you to assume that Descartes and Hume\nA) defend the senses as a original criterion to consider a legitimate knowledge.\nB) They understand that it is unnecessary to suspect the meaning of an idea in philosophical and critical reflection.\nC) They are legitimate representatives of criticism as to the genesis of knowledge.\nD) agree that human knowledge is impossible in relation to ideas and senses.\nE) attribute different places to the role of the senses in the process of obtaining knowledge."
