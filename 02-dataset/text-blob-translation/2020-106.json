  "text": "Question 101) Even for aquarium fish, such as the rainbow fish, the water temperature outside the ideal range (26 ° C to 28 ° C), as well as its sudden variation, can affect the animal's health. To maintain the water temperature inside the aquarium in the desired average, thermostat heating devices are used. For example, for a 50 L aquarium, an optimized 50 W heating system can be used to supply its cooling rate. This rate can be considered practically constant, as the temperature outside the aquarium is maintained by the greenhouses. Use for water the specific heat 4.0 kJ kg - 1 k - 1 and density 1 kg l - 1.\nIf the heating system is turned off for 1 h, what is the closest value to reduce the water temperature of the aquarium?\nA) 4.0 ° C\nB) 3.6 ° C\nC) 0.9 ° C\nD) 0.6 ° C\nE) 0.3 ° C"
