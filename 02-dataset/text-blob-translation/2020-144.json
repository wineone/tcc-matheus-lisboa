  "text": "Question 139) A two -story house is being projected. It is necessary to include in the project the construction of a ladder for access to the second floor. For the calculation of the dimensions of the steps the rules are used: | 2h + B-63.5 | ≤ 1.5 and 16 ≤ h ≤ 19, in which h is the height of the step (called mirror) and b is the depth of the foot, as shown in fira. For convenience, the height of the step was chosen as H = 16. The units of H and B are in centimeter.\nIn this case, the broadest numerical interval to which the depth of the footstep (B) must belong, so that the rules are satisfied is\nA) 30 ≤ b\nB) 30 ≤ b ≤ 31.5\nC) 30 ≤ b ≤ 33\nD) 31.5 ≤ b ≤ 33\nE) B ≤ 33"
