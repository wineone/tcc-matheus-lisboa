  "text": "Question 59) Land plants that are still in the growth phase fix large amounts of CO2, using it to form new organic molecules, and release a large amount of O2. However, in mature forests, whose trees have already reached balance, O2 consumption by breathing tends to match their production by photosynthesis. The natural death of trees in these forests temporarily affects the concentration of O2 and CO2 near the surface of the soil where they fell.\nThe concentration of O2 near the ground, at the site of the fall, will be\nA) smaller, as there will be O2 consumption during the decomposition of these trees.\nB) greater, because there will be economy of O2 for the absence of dead trees.\nC) greater, as there will be release of O2 during photosynthesis of young trees.\nD) equal, as there will be consumption and production of O2 by the remaining mature trees.\nE) lower, as there will be reduction of O2 due to the lack of photosynthesis performed by the dead trees."
