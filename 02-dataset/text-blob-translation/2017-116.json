  "text": "Question 111) Fuse is a circuit overcurrent protection device. When the current passing through this electrical component is greater than its maximum nominal current, the fuse burns. This prevents the high current from damaging the circuit devices. Suppose the electrical circuit shown is powered by a voltage source U and that the fuse supports a nominal current of 500 mA.\nFuse 60 Ω 60 Ω 60 Ω 40 Ω 30 Ω 120 Ω What is the maximum value of the voltage U so that the fuse does not burn?\nA) 20 V\nB) 40 V\nC) 60 V\nD) 120 V\nE) 185 V"
