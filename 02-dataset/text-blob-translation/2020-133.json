  "text": "Question 128) Sacarase (or invertase) is an enzyme that acts on the human gut hydrolyzing the saccharose disaccharide in monosaccharides glucose and fructose. In a kinetic study of the sucrose hydrolysis reaction (C12H22O11), 171 g of sucrose were dissolved in 500 ml of water. It was observed that every 100 minutes of reaction, the sucrose concentration was halved, whatever the moment chosen as the initial time. The molar masses of elements H, C and O are equal to 1, 12 and 16 g mol - 1, respectively.\nWhat is the sucrose concentration after 400 minutes from the beginning of the hydrolysis reaction?\nA) 2.50 × 10−3 mol l - 1\nB) 6.25 × 10−2 mol l - 1\nC) 1.25 × 10−1 mol l - 1\nD) 2.50 × 10−1 mol l - 1\nE) 4.27 × 10−1 mol l - 1"
