  "text": "Question 137) Many physiological and biochemical processes, such as heartbeat and breathing rate, have scales built from the relationship between surface and mass (or volume) of the animal. One of these scales, for example, considers that “the surface area of ​​the surface of a mammal is proportional to the square of its mass m”.\nThis is equivalent to say that for a constant K> 0, area S can be written as a function of M by expression:\nA) s = k • m\nB) s = k • m 1 3\nC) s = k 1 • m 1 3 3\nD) s = k 1 • m 2 3 3\nE) s = k 1 • m 2 3"
