  "text": "Question 41) The baby of Tarlatana Rosa-[...] on Tuesday I turned off the group and fell into the high sea of ​​depravity, with a lightweight outfit over the skin and all the bad instincts. Otherwise the whole city was like this. It is the moment when behind the masks the girls confess passions to the boys, it is the moment when the most secret calls show, when virginity is dubious, and we all find it useless, honor a cacetation, common sense a fatigue. At this point everything is possible, the greatest nonsense, the greatest crimes; Right now there is a laugh that galvanizes the senses and the kiss is naturally untied.\nI was trembling, with an eagerness to poll me, almost morbid. No fragrant galim girls and too well known, no family contact, but anonymous mockery, the ritual mockery of arriving, catching, ending, continuing. It was ignoble. Fortunately a lot of people suffer from the same harm at Carnival.\nRIO, J. Within night. São Paulo: Antiqua, 2002.\nIn the text, the character lies to Carnival attitudes and collective reactions in which he expresses\nA) Consecration of the joy of the people.\nB) attraction and asco before libertine attitudes.\nC) Amazing with the amount of revelers on the streets.\nD) intention to fraternize with strangers.\nE) recognition of the feast as a cultural manifestation."
