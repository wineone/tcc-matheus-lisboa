  "text": "Question 54) An important principle of biology, related to the transmission of characters and human embryogenesis, was broken with the discovery of fetal microcimerism. Microquimerism is the name given to the biological phenomenon regarding a small population of cells or DNA present in an individual, but derived from a genetically distinct organism. Investigating the presence of the Y chromosome, it was revealed that several women's tissues contained men's cells. The analysis of the medical history revealed an extremely curious correlation: only women who previously had children had male microchemism. This correlation led to the interpretation that there is a natural exchange between fetus cells and maternal during pregnancy.\nMOTRI, A. You are not just you: we carry maternal cells in most of our the contested principle with this discovery, related to the development of the human body, is that that\nA) The phenotype of our cells may change by influence of the environment.\nB) Genetic dominance determines the expression of some genes.\nC) Genetic mutations introduce variability in genome.\nD) The mitochondria and their DNA come from the maternal gamete.\nE) Our body cells come from a single zygote."
