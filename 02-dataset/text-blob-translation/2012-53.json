  "text": "Question 53) The label of an aerosol deodorant informs the consumer that the product has in its composition the isobutan, butano and propane gases, among other substances. In addition to this information, the label also brings the inscription “does not contain CFC”. The following reactions, which occur in the stratosphere, justify the non -use of CFC (chlorofluorcarbono or freon) in this deodorant: i) CF2Cℓ2 cf2cℓ + Cℓ UV II) Cℓ + O3 O2 + Cℓo • • • • • Concern with possible threats to Ozone layer (O3) is based on its main function: to protect living matter on the land from the harmful effects of ultraviolet sunlight. Ultraviolet radiation absorption by stratospheric ozone is intense enough to eliminate much of the ultraviolet fraction that is harmful to life.\nThe purpose of the use of isobutane, butane and propane gases in this aerosol is\nA) Replace CFC, as it does not react with ozone, serving as propelent gases in aerosols.\nB) Serve as propelent, because, as they are very reactive, they capture the free existing freon in the atmosphere, preventing the destruction of ozone.\nC) react with air, as they decompose spontaneously on carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O), which do not attack ozone.\nD) prevent ozone destruction by CFC, as gas hydrocarbons react with UV radiation, releasing hydrogen (H2), which reacts with oxygen from the air (O2), forming water (H2O).\nE) destroy the CFC, as it react with UV radiation, releasing carbon (C), which reacts with oxygen from the air (O2), forming carbon dioxide (CO2), which is harmless to the ozone layer."
