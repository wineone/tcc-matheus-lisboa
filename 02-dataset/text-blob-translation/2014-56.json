  "text": "Question 56) Diesel is a mixture of hydrocarbons that also has sulfur in its composition. This sulfur is an undesirable component, as generated sulfur trioxide is one of the great causes of acid rain. In the 1980s, there was no regulation and diesel oil was used with 13 000 ppm sulfur. In 2009, diesel had 1 800 ppm sulfur (S1800) and then inserted diesel S500 (500 ppm) in the market. In 2012, the S50 diesel, with 50 ppm sulfur in its composition, was widespread. Currently, a diesel with even smaller sulfur contents is produced.\nThe replacement of diesel used in the 1980s with the widespread in 2012 allowed a percentage reduction of emission of SO3 of\nA) 86.2%.\nB) 96.2%.\nC) 97.2%.\nD) 99.6%.\nE) 99.9%."
