  "text": "QUESTION 85) A device develops to automatically open a port where a button, when activated, causes an electric current i = 6 to a conductive bar of length L = 5 cm, whose midpoint is stuck to a spring of elastic constant k = 5 × 10–2 n/cm. The spring-consent system is immersed in a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the plane. When the button is triggered, the bar will come out of the equilibrium position at an average speed of 5 m/s and reach the turnstile in 6 milliseconds, opening the door. x (cm) 0 insulating spring Ratchet wire x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x b v i the intensity of the magnetic field, so that the disposative works properly, is\nA) 5 × 10–1 T.\nB) 5 × 10–2 T.\nC) 5 × 101 T.\nD) 2 × 10–2 T.\nE) 2 × 100 T."
