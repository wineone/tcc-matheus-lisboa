  "text": "Question 17) One of the most striking criticism of the discourse of health -related physical fitness is in the eminently individual character of its proposals, which serves to obscure other determinants of health. That is, the individual is usually presented as the problem and the change of lifestyle as the solution. It is also argued that the movement of health-related physical fitness considers the existence of a homogeneous culture in which everyone would be free to choose their lifestyles, which does not match reality. The fact is that we live in a society divided into social classes, in which not all people have economic conditions to adopt an active and healthy lifestyle. There are structural inequalities with political, economic and social roots that make it difficult to adopt these lifestyles.\nFERREIRA, M. S.
