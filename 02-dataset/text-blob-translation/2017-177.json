  "text": "Question 172) Solar energy will supply part of the campus energy demand from a Brazilian university. The installation of solar panels in the parking area and coverage of the Pediatric Hospital will be used at university facilities and also linked to the network of the Energy Distributor Company.\nThe project includes 100 m² of solar panels that will be installed in the parking lots, producing electricity and providing shade for cars. About the pediatric hospital will be placed approximately 300 m² of panels, 100 m² to generate electricity used in the campus, and 200 m² for thermal energy generation, producing water heating used in hospital boilers.\nSuppose each square meter of solar panel for electricity generates a savings of 1 kWh a day and each square meter producing thermal energy allows saving 0.7 kWh a day to the university. In a second phase of the project, the area covered by the solar panels that generate electricity will be increased by 75%. In this phase the coverage area with panels for thermal power generation should also be expanded.\nTo get twice the amount of energy saved daily, compared to the first phase, the total area of ​​the panels that generate thermal energy, in square meter, must have the closer value of\nA) 231.\nB) 431.\nC) 472.\nD) 523.\nE) 672."
