  "text": "Question 104) With each crop, the amount of coffee benefited is equal to the amount of waste generated by its beneficiation. The residue can be used as fertilizer, as it contains about 6.5% pectin (a polysaccharide), approximately 25% of fermentable sugars (fructose, sucrose and galactose), as well as alkaloid residues (amine compounds) that were not extracted in the process.\nLIMA, L. K. S. et al. Use of waste from the roasting of coffee in agriculture to replace conventional fertilization. ACSA-scientific agriculture in the semi-arid, this residue contributes to the fertility of the soil, because\nA) enables carbon and nitrogen recycling.\nB) Promotes aluminum displacement, which is toxic.\nC) Improves soil compaction because of the presence of pectin.\nD) raises soil pH as a function of the degradation of waste components.\nE) has growth inhibitors for most plant species by caffeine."
