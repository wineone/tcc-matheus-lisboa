  "text": "Question 88) Magnetohipertermia is a therapeutic procedure that is based on the elevation of cell temperature in a specific region of the body that are affected by a tumor. In this type of treatment, magnetic nanoparticles are phagocyted by tumor cells, and an alternate external magnetic field is used to promote the agitation of nanoparticles and consequent cell heating.\nThe temperature rise described occurs because\nA) The magnetic field generated by the oscillation of nanoparticles is absorbed by the tumor.\nB) The alternating magnetic field makes the nanoparticles rotate, transferring heat by friction.\nC) Nanoparticles interact magnetically with the cells of the body, transferring heat.\nD) The alternating magnetic field provides heat to the nanoparticles that transfers it to body cells.\nE) Nanoparticles are accelerated in one sense due to interaction with the magnetic field, colliding with the cells and transferring heat."
