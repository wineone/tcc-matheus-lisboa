  "text": "Question 22) Text I Ticuna language is the most spoken language among Brazilian indigenous people. According to researcher Aryon Rodrigues, there are 40,000 Indians who speak the language. Most live along the Solimões River, in the High Amazonas. It is the largest indigenous nation in Brazil, and is also found in Peru and Colombia. Ticunas speak a language considered isolated, which does not maintain resemblance to any other indigenous language and has complexities in their phonology and syntax. Its main feature is the use of different heights in the voice.\nIntensive language use is not threatened by the proximity of cities or even by living with speakers of other languages ​​within the ticuna area itself: in villages, these other speakers are minority and eventually submit to Ticuna reality, which is why Perhaps they do not represent a linguistic threat.\nText II Wealth of Language “English is intended to be a wider world language than Latin was in the past era and the Frenchman is in the present,” said American President John Adams in the eighteenth century. Prophecy has been fulfilled: English is today the frank language of globalization. At the opposite end of the worldwide linguistic economy are the languages ​​of small declining communities. It is estimated that today they speak from 6,000 to 7 000 languages ​​worldwide. Almost half of them should disappear over the next 100 years. The latest edition of Ethnologog - the most comprehensive study of the 2005 world languages ​​- listed 516 languages ​​at risk of extinction.\nThe texts deal with completely different cultures languages, whose realities approach according to the\nA) Similarity in expansion mode.\nB) Preference of use in the spoken modality.\nC) mode of organization of syntactic rules.\nD) predominance in relation to other contact languages.\nE) fact of motivating the disappearance of minority languages."
