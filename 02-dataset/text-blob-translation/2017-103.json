  "text": "Question 98) In order to explain one of the properties of the plasma membrane, a mouse cell with a human cell was fused, forming a hybrid cell. Then, in order to mark membrane proteins, two antibodies were inserted into the experiment, one specific for mouse membrane proteins and another for human membrane proteins. The antibodies were visualized to the microscope by fluorescence of different colors.\nHuman Human Cell Cell Hybrid Hybrid Cell Antibody against mouse membrane protein marked with fluorescein. Antibodies against human membrane protein marked with rodamine.\nIncubation at 37 Â° C membrane protein Time = 0 minute time = 40 minutes membrane protein Cell fusion step 1 step 2 step 3 step 4 The observed change from step 3 to step 4 of the experiment occurs because the proteins\nA) They move freely in the plane of the lipid bicam.\nB) remain confirmed in certain regions of the bicamada.\nC) assist the displacement of plasma membrane phospholipids.\nD) are mobilized due to the insertion of antibodies.\nE) are blocked by antibodies."
