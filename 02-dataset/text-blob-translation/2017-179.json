  "text": "QUESTION 174) In this thermometer model, the black killes record the minimum and maximum temperatures of the previous day and the gray -to -gray chills record the current ambient temperature, ie at the time of reading the thermometer. −30 −20 −10 10 20 30 40 50 0 50 40 30 20 10 −10 −20 −30 0 Therefore it has two columns. In the left, the numbers are in increasing order, from top to bottom, from −30 ° C to 50 ° C. In the right column, the numbers are increasingly sorted from the bottom to −30 ° C to 50 ° C.\nReading is done as follows: • The minimum temperature is indicated by the lower level of the black hand on the left column; • The maximum temperature is indicated by the lower level of the black son in the right column; • The current temperature is indicated by the upper level of the gray killer in both columns.\nWhat is the most approximate maximum temperature recorded on this thermometer?\nA) 5 ° C\nB) 7 ° C\nC) 13 ° C\nD) 15 ° C\nE) 19 ° C"
