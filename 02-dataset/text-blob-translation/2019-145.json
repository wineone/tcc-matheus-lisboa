  "text": "Question 140) Hydrangea macrophylla is a plant with blue or pink flower, depending on the pH of the soil in which it is planted. In acidic soil (ie, with pH <7) the flower is blue, while in alkaline soil (ie with pH> 7) the flower is pink. Consider that the most commercially valued pink hydrangea in a particular region is that produced on soil with pH less than 8. It is known that pH =-log10x, where x is the concentration of hydrogen ion (H+).\nTo produce the pink hydrangea of ​​higher commercial value, you must prepare the soil so that X assumes\nA) Any value above 10-8.\nB) any positive value less than 10-7.\nC) values ​​greater than 7 and less than 8.\nD) values ​​greater than 70 and less than 80.\nE) values ​​greater than 10-8 and less than 10-7."
