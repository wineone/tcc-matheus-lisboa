  "text": "Question 113) Road This road where I live, between two laps, is more than an urban avenue.\nIn cities all people look like.\nEverybody is equal. Everyone is everyone.\nHere, no: you feel well that each one brings their soul.\nEach creature is unique.\nEven the dogs.\nThese garden dogs look like business men: they are always worried.\nAnd how many people come and go! And everything has that impressive character that makes it meditate: burial on foot or the milk carrier pulled by a sly goat.\nNo lack the murmur of water, to suggest, through the voice of the symbols, that life goes through! That life passes! And that youth will end.\nBANDEIRA, M. The dissolution rhythm. Rio de Janeiro: Aguilar, 1967.\nManuel Bandeira's lyric is based on the apprehension of deep meanings from everyday elements. In the poem Estrada, the lyricism present in the contrast between Campo e Cidade points to\nA) The desire of the lyrical self to rescue the movement of urban centers, which reveals its nostalgia with the city.\nB) the perception of the ephemeral character of life, made possible by observing the apparent inertia of rural life.\nC) The lyrical self option through bucolic space as a possibility of meditation on his youth.\nD) the negative view of the passage of time, since it generates insecurity.\nE) the deep sense of fear generated by reflection on death."
