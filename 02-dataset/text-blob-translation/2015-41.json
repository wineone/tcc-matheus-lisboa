  "text": "Question 41) Faced with threats that emerged with genetic food engineering, several groups of civil society conceived the so -called “precautionary principle”. The foundation of this principle is: when a technology or product involves some threat to health or the environment, even if the precise nature or the magnitude of the damage that may be caused by them cannot be evaluated, they should avoid or leave them quarantine for higher studies and evaluations before its release. SEVCENKO, N. The race for the 21st century: in the loop of the roller coaster. The text exposes a representative tendency of contemporary social thinking, in which the development of caution mechanisms or risk administration aims to\nA) prioritize economic interests in relation to human beings and nature.\nB) deny the scientific perspective and its achievements because of ecological risks.\nC) institute public dialogue on technological changes and its consequences.\nD) Combat the introduction of technologies to lock the course of social changes.\nE) break the balance between benefits and risks of technological and scientific advance."
