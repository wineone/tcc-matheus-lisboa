  "text": "Question 65) Vegetables biosynthesize certain substances (eg alkaloids and flavonoids), whose chemical structure and concentration vary in the same organism at different times of the year and developmental stages. Many of these substances are produced for the body's adaptation to environmental variations (UV radiation, temperature, parasites, herbivores, stimulating pollinators, etc.) or physiological (growth, aging, etc.).\nQualitative and quantitative variations in the production of these substances for a year are possible because the individual's genetic material\nA) It suffers constant recombinations to adapt.\nB) changes throughout the year and at different stages of life.\nC) creates new genes for biosynthesis of specific substances.\nD) alters the sequence of nitrogenous bases to create new substances.\nE) has transcribed genes differently according to each need."
