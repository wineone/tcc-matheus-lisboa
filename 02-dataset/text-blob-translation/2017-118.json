  "text": "Question 113) Quincke trombone is an experimental device used to demonstrate the phenomenon of sound wave interference. A source emits sound waves of a certain frequency at the device input. These waves are divided by the two paths (ADC and AEC) and are at point C, the device output, where a detector is positioned. The ADC route can be increased by the displacement of this part of the device. With the ADC route equal to the AEC, a very intense sound is captured at the exit. However, gradually increasing the ADC path, until it is shown in the figure, the intensity of the sound at the virtually null output. Thus, known the speed of sound inside the tube (320 m/s), it is possible to determine the frequency value of the sound produced by the source.\nSound source Sound input 40 cm Sound output Detector 30 cm The frequency value, in Hertz, the sound produced by the sound source is\nA) 3 200.\nB) 1 600.\nC) 800.\nD) 640.\nE) 400."
