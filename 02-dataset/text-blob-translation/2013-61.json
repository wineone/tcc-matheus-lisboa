  "text": "Question 61) To offer accessibility to people with mobility difficulties, the hydraulic elevator is used in buses and cars. This device is used an electric pump, to force a fluid to pass from a narrow tubing to another wider, and thus trigger a piston that moves the platform. Consider a hydraulic elevator whose piston head area is five times larger than the pump pipe area. Disregarding the friction and considering a gravitational acceleration of 10 m/s2, one wants to raise a 65 kg person in a 15 kg wheelchair over the 20 kg platform.\nWhat should be the strength exerted by the pump engine over the fluid so that the wheelchair is high at constant speed?\nA) 20 n\nB) 100 N\nC) 200 n\nD) 1 000 N\nE) 5 000 N"
