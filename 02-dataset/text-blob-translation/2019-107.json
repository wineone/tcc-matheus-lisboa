  "text": "Question 102) Cutias, small rodents of tropical zones, carry the seeds that fall from the trees by the mouth, but instead of eating them, they bury them elsewhere. This procedure allows them to save most of their seeds buried to the driest times when there are no mature fruits available. Scientists have found that the cuties steal the seeds buried by others, and this \"thieves\" behavior makes the same seed be buried dozens of times.\nThis “thieves” is associated with the relationship of\nA) Sinfilia.\nB) Predatism.\nC) parasitism.\nD) competition.\nE) commensalism."
