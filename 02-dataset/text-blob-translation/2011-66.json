  "text": "Question 66) An engine can only do work if you receive a power amount from another system. In this case, the energy stored in the fuel is partly released during combustion so that the device can work. When the engine operates, part of the energy converted or transformed into combustion cannot be used to perform work. This means that there is a leakage of energy in another form.\nAccording to the text, the energy transformations that occur during engine operation are due to the\nA) Heat release within the engine is impossible.\nB) work for the engine to be uncontrollable.\nC) Integral conversion of heat to work is impossible.\nD) transformation of thermal energy into kinetics is impossible.\nE) Use of potential fuel energy is uncontrollable."
