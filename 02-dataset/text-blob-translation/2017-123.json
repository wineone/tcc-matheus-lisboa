  "text": "Question 118) Duchenne muscle dystrophy (DMD) is a disease caused by a mutation in a gene located on the X chromosome. Researchers studied a family in which monozygous twins were carried a mutant allele recessive to this (heterozygous gene). Interestingly, one of the twins had the phenotype related to the mutant allele, that is, DMD, while his sister had a normal phenotype.\nThe difference in the manifestation of DMD among the twins can be explained by the\nA) Incomplete dominance of the mutant allele in relation to the normal allele.\nB) failure in the separation of chromosomes X at the time of separation of the two embryos.\nC) chromosomal recombination in an embryonic cell division prior to the separation of the two embryos.\nD) random inactivation of one of the chromosomes X after the division that results in both embryos.\nE) paternal origin of the chromosome carrier of the mutant allele in one of the twins and maternal origin in the other."
