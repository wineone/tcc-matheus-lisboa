  "text": "Question 44) I participated in an interview with musician Renato Teixeira. One time someone asked to list the differences between old and current country music. His answer surprised everyone: “There is no difference. Caipira music has always been the same. It is a song that mirrors the life of man in the countryside, and music does not lie. What changed was not music, but life in the countryside. ” It makes perfect sense: the country music of root exuded a loneliness, a certain distance from the “modern” country. Requiring the same of a song made today, in a connected, globalized and rich interior as we have, it is impossible. For good or evil, music reflects its own time.\nThe cultural question indicated in the text emphasizes the following socioeconomic aspect of the current Brazilian field:\nA) Growth of the extensive production system.\nB) Expansion of activities of the new ruralities.\nC) Persistence of compulsory labor relations.\nD) containment of the policy of agricultural subsidies.\nE) Strengthening of the cooperative organization model."
