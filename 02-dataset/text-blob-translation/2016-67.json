  "text": "Question 67) First, in relation to what we call water when it freezes, it seems to be looking at something that has become stone or earth, but when it melts and disperses, it becomes breathless and air; The air, when it is burned, becomes fire; and, conversely, the fire, when it contracts and extinguished, returns to the form of the air; Air, again concentrated and contracted, becomes cloud and fog, but from these states, if it is even more compressed, it becomes running water, and of water becomes earth and stones again; And in this way, as we seem to generate each other cyclically.\nPlato. TIMEU-CRITES. Coimbra: Cech, 2011.\nFrom the point of view of modern science, the “four elements” described by Plato correspond, in fact, to the solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma phases of matter. The transitions between them are now understood as macroscopic consequences of transformations suffered by matter on a microscopic scale.\nExcept for the plasma phase, these transformations suffered by matter, at the microscopic level, are associated with a\nA) exchange of atoms between the different molecules of the material.\nB) nuclear transmutation of the chemical elements of the material.\nC) proton redistribution between the different atoms of the material.\nD) change in the spatial structure formed by the different constituents of the material.\nE) change in the proportions of the different isotopes of each element present in the material."
