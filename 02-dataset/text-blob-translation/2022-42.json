  "text": "Question 37) “Perfect Life” on social networks can affect mental health on various social networks that populate the internet, so -called digital influencers are always happy and preach happiness as a lifestyle. These people spread content to thousands of followers, dictating trend and showing a lifestyle dreamed by many, such as slooking body, amazing trips, stunning houses, new cars and full -time joy, something very unlikely to happen all the time, points out Carla Furtado, Master in Psychology and Founder of the Feliciência Institute.\nThe problem can arise with the incessant search for this happiness, which generates side effects on those who consume daily the “perfect life” of others. Hence comes the concept of toxic positivity: the expression has been used to address a kind of pressure on the adoption of a positive discourse, combined with a life -edited life for social networks. To maintain mental health and avoid being hit by toxic positivity, the rational use of social networks is the most appropriate, advises psychiatrist Renata Nayara Figueiredo, president of the Psychiatric Association of Brasilia (APBR).\nAssociated with the ideal of a “perfect life”, the toxic positivity mentioned in the text is a recent social phenomenon, which is based on\nA) Stereotyped and superficial representations of happiness.\nB) contemporary resignifications of the concept of joy.\nC) inaccessible lifestyles for Brazilian society.\nD) contradictory attitudes of digital influencers.\nE) idealized and harmful patterns of physical beauty."
