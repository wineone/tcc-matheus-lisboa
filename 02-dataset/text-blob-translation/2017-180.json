  "text": "Question 175) Central pivot is a widely used irrigation system in agriculture, where a circular area is designed to receive a suspended structure. In the center of this area, there is a vertical pipe that transmits water through a long horizontal pipe, supported by support towers, which rotate, on wheels, around the center of the pivot, also called the base, as shown in the figures. Each tower moves with constant speed.\nBase T1 T2 T3 A pivot of three towers (T1, T2 and T3) will be installed on a farm, and the distances between consecutive towers as well as from the base to the T1 tower are equal to 50 m. The farmer intends to adjust the velocities of the towers, so that the pivot makes a full return in 25 hours. Use 3 as approach to Ï€.\nTo achieve its goal, the velocities of the T1, T2 and T3 towers must be, in meter per hour,\nA) 12, 24 and 36.\nB) 6, 12 and 18.\nC) 2, 4 and 6.\nD) 300, 1 200 and 2 700.\nE) 600, 2 400 and 5 400."
