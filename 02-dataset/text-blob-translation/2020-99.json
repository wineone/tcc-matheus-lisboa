  "text": "Question 94) Traditional headphones transmit music directly to our ears. Already the models with noise reduction technology - noise cancellation (CR) - in addition to transmitting music, also reduce all the noise inconsistent around us, such as the noise of plane turbines and vacuum cleaners. CR headphones do not really reduce irregular noises such as speech and babies of babies. Even so, the suppression of the plane turbines snoring contributes to reducing “noise fatigue”, a persistent tiredness caused by exposure to a loud noise for hours on end. These devices also allow us to listen to songs or watch videos on the train or plane at a much smaller (and safer) volume.\nIs CR noise technology used in the production of headphones based on which wave phenomenon?\nA) absorption.\nB) interference.\nC) polarization.\nD) reflection.\nE) diffraction."
