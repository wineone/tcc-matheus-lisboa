  "text": "Question 75) A researcher realizes that the label of one of the glasses in which he holds a concentrate of digestive enzymes is unreadable. He does not know which enzyme the glass contains, but suspects it is a gastric protease, which acts on the stomach by digesting proteins. Knowing that stomach digestion is acidic and in the intestine is basic, it assembles five test tubes with different foods, adds the concentrate of enzymes in solutions with determined pH and waits to see if the enzyme acts in any of them.\nThe test tube in which the enzyme must act to indicate that the researcher's hypothesis is correct is the one that contains\nA) Potato cube in solution with pH = 9.\nB) piece of meat in solution with pH = 5.\nC) egg white cooked in a solution with pH = 9.\nD) portion of pasta in solution with pH = 5.\nE) butter ball in solution with pH = 9."
