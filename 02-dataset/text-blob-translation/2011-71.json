Biofuels derived from cellulosic material or second generation biofuels - colloquially called “grass gasoline” - are those produced from wood waste (sawdust, for example), corn stalks, wheat straw or rapid growth grass and if They present as an alternative to the problems faced by the first generation, as the raw materials are cheap and abundant.\nDALE, B. E.; HUBER, G. W. grass gasoline and other vegetables. The text shows one of the points of view about the use of biofuels today, which\nA) These are energy matrices with lower pollution load for the environment and can provide the generation of new jobs, however, to be offered at low cost, the technology of cellulose degradation in second generation biofuels must be extremely efficient.\nB) offer multiple difficulties, as production is of high cost, their implementation does not generate jobs, and care should be taken with environmental risk, as they offer the same risks as the use of fossil fuels.\nC) being second generation, they are produced by a technology that causes social problems, especially due to the fact that the raw material is abundant and easily found, which prevents the generation of new jobs.\nD) Being first and second generation, they are produced by technologies that should undergo a careful assessment of use, as one faces the problem of lack of space to plant raw material and the other prevents the generation of new sources of employment .\nE) may lead to serious economic and social problems, as the replacement of oil use negatively affects a entire production chain as it excludes various sources of employment in refineries, gas stations and oil and gasoline transportation."
