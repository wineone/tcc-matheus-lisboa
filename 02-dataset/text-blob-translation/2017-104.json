  "text": "Question 99) Figure shows how electromagnetic radiation emission is to five types of lamp: metallic halide, tungsten, mercury, xenon and led (light -emitter diode). The areas marked in gray are proportional to the intensity of the energy released by the lamp. The dotted lines show the sensitivity of the human eye to the different wavelengths. UV and IV are the regions of Ultraviolet and Infrared, respectively.\nAn architect wants to illuminate a room using a lamp that produces good lighting but does not heat the environment.\nMetal halide Tungsten Mercury Xenon Emitted Intensity LED 300 200 900 800 700 600 500 400 UV IV Visible wavelength (NM) Which type of lamp best meets the architect's desire?\nA) Metallic halide.\nB) Tungsten.\nC) Mercury.\nD) xenon.\nHE D."
