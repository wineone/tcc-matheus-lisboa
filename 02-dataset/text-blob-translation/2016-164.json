  "text": "Question 159) A cabinetmaker is building a teaching material that corresponds to the 10 cm high pieces of wood pieces and varied geometric shapes, in a wooden block where each piece positions itself in the perforation with its corresponding shape, as illustrated. The wooden block already has three ready -made perforations of distinct bases: a square (Q), aside 4 cm, a rectangular (r), based 3 cm and height 4 cm, and one in the shape of an equilateral triangle (t) aside 6.8 cm. Missing a circular base drilling (C). The cabinetmaker does not want the other pieces to fit into circular drilling or that the circular base piece fits into other perforations and, for this, will choose the diameter of the circle that meets such conditions. He sought in his tools a glass saw (circular -shaped drill) to pierce the wood base, finding five specimens, with different measurements of diameters, as follows: (i) 3.8 cm; (Ii) 4.7 cm; (III) 5.6 cm; (IV) 7.2 cm and (v) 9.4 cm.\nConsider 1.4 and 1.7 as approaches to √2 and √3, respectively.\nTo achieve your goal, which of the copies of Serra cup the cabinetmaker should choose?\nTHERE\nB) II\nC) III\nD) IV\nE) v"
