  "text": "Question 101) In an optical information transmission line, when a signal decreases its intensity to values ​​below 10 dB, it needs to be relayed. However, intensities greater than 100 dB cannot be properly transmitted. Figure presents how signal loss (optical loss) is given to different wavelengths for a certain type of optical finishing.\nWave length (µm) Optical loss (dB/km) 0.8 1 2 3 4 5 6 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1 , 8 What is the maximum distance, in km, that a sign can be sent in this figure without requiring relay?\nA) 6\nB) 18\nC) 60\nD) 90\nE) 100"
