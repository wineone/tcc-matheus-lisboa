  "text": "Question 08) One of the main objectives of continuing the erosion research of soils is to seek to solve the problems arising from this process, which ultimately generates a number of environmental impacts. In addition, for the adoption of soil conservation techniques, it is necessary to know how water performs its work of removal, transportation and deposition of sediment. Erosion almost always causes a number of environmental problems, at the local level or even in large areas.\nWAR, A. J. T. Erosive processes on the slopes. In: WAR, A. J. T.; CUNHA, S. B. Geomorphology: an update of bases and concepts.\nSoil preservation, especially in slope areas, can be a solution to avoid disasters as a function of water flow intensity. Human practice that goes on the way against this solution is\nA) The action.\nB) the terracementation.\nC) the inhes.\nD) the drainage.\nE) deforestation."
