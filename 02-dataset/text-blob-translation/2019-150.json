  "text": "Question 145) In an online game, each player seeks to rise level and increase their experience, which are two important parameters in the game, on which the participant's defense and attack forces depend. Each player's defense force is directly proportional to his level and square of his experience, while his attacking force is directly proportional to his experience and the square of his level. No player knows the level or experience of the others. Players start the game at Level 1 with experience 1 and have attacking force 2 and defense 1. In this game, each participant moves in a city in search of treasures to increase their experience. When two of them meet, one can challenge the other to a confrontation, being the challenger considered the attacker. It is then compared to the challenging force of attack with the challenge's defense force and the confrontation overcomes the one whose strength is greater.
