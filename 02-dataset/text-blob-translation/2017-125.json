  "text": "Question 120) Several natural products can be obtained from plants by extraction process. The lapachol is from the naphtochinone class. Its structure has an enolic hydroxyl (PKA = 6.0) that allows this compound to be isolated from the sawdust of the ipês by extraction with proper solution, followed by simple defilement. Consider that pka = −Log Ka, where Ka is the acid constant of the lapachol ionization reaction.\nOH LAPACHOL COSTA, P. R. R. et al. Acids and bases in organic chemistry. Which solution should be used for Lapachol Extraction from IPê sawdust with greater efficiency?\nA) Na2CO3 solution to form a lapachol salt.\nB) Acetic acid tampon solution/sodium acetate (pH = 4.5).\nC) NaCl solution of increasing the ionic force of the environment.\nD) Na2SO4 solution to form an ionic pair with lapachol.\nE) HCl solution to extract it by acid-base reaction."
