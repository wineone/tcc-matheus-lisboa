  "text": "QUESTION 134) A diver is arrested by exploring a cave in the ocean. Inside the cave was formed an air pocket, as shown in the fi gura, where the diver housed.\nDuring the rescue, to avoid damage to your body, it was necessary for the diver to undergo a decompression process before returning to the surface so that his body was again under atmospheric pressure. Chart shows the relationship between recommended decompression times for individuals in this situation and pressure variation.\nDecompression time (min) Pressure variation (kPa) 100 80 60 20 20 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 Consider that gravity acceleration is 10 m s - 2 and that water density is œÅ = 1 000 kg M - 3.\nIn minutes, what is the decompression time the diver should be subjected to?\nA) 100\nB) 80\nC) 60\nD) 40\nE) 20"
