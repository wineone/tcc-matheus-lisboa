  "text": "Question 60) The females of some species of spiders, scorpions and other invertebrates predict males after copulation and insemination. As an example, insect cannibal females known as Mantis-to-God, Tenodera Aridofolia, have up to 63% of their diet consisting of male partner males. For females, sexual cannibalism can ensure important nutrients in reproduction. With this increase in the diet, they usually produce more eggs.\nDespite being seemingly disadvantageous for males, sexual cannibalism has evolved in these animal taxa because\nA) Promotes the highest occupation of different ecological niches by the species.\nB) favors the individual reproductive success of both parenting.\nC) Impossible the transmission of male genes to offspring.\nD) prevents the survival and future reproduction of the male.\nE) reduces the genetic variability of the population."
