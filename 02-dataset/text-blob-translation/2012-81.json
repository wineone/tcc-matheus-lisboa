  "text": "Question 81) Paleontologists study fossils and dinosaur skeletons to try to explain the disappearance of these animals. These studies allow us to state that these animals were extinct about 65 million years ago. One theory currently accepted is that an asteroid collided with the earth, forming a dense cloud of dust in the atmosphere.\nAccording to this theory, the extinction occurred due to modifications on the planet that\nA) destabilized the biological clock of animals, causing changes in the genetic code.\nB) reduced the penetration of sunlight to the surface of the earth, interfering with the energy flow of the trophic webs.\nC) caused a series of poisoning in animals, causing bioaccumulation of dust particles in organisms.\nD) resulted in the sedimentation of the dust particles raised with the impact of the meteor, causing the disappearance of rivers and lakes.\nE) avoided water rainfall to the earth's surface, causing a large drought that prevented feedback of the hydrological cycle."
