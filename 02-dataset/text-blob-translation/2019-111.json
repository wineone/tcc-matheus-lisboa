  "text": "Question 106) Based on Mendel's plant experiments, three basic principles were established, which are known as uniformity laws, segregation and independent distribution. The independent distribution law refers to the fact that members of different pairs of genes segregate independently, from each other, to the offspring.\nToday, it is known that this is not always true. Why?\nA) The distribution depends on the character of dominance or recessiveness of the gene.\nB) Organisms do not always inherit each of the genes of each of the parents.\nC) Chromosomal changes may lead to failures in segregation during meiosis.\nD) The physically close genes in the same chromosome tend to be inherited together.\nE) The chromosome that contains two certain genes may not suffer the disjunction in the first phase of meiosis."
