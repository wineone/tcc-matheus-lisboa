  "text": "Question 104) Why don't ants die when posting in a microwave oven? The microwaves are very high electromagnetic waves. They cause vibration in water molecules, and that is what warms the food. If the dish is dry, its temperature does not change. Similarly, if the ants have little water on your body, they can be unscathed. Already a human being would not do as well as these insects within a superdimened microwave oven: the water that makes 70% of his body would warm. Low-intensity microwaves, however, are everywhere, from cellular telephony, but there is no proof that they cause problems for the human population.\nThe texts are built with linguistic resources that materialize different communicative purposes. In answering the question that gives title to the text, the author has as main objective\nA) Defend the point of view that electromagnetic waves are harmless.\nB) Disseminate results from recent scientific research for society.\nC) present information about electromagnetic waves and their use.\nD) Alert the reader about the risks of using the microwaves in their daily lives.\nE) point out physiological differences between ants and humans."
