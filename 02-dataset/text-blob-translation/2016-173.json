  "text": "Question 168) Absolute density (D) is the reason between the mass of a body and the volume occupied by it. One teacher proposed to his class for students to analyze the density of three bodies: DA, DB, DC. The students found that the body A had 1.5 time the mass of body B and this, in turn, had 3 4 of body mass C. They also observed that the volume of the body A was the same as the body B and 20% higher than body volume C.\nAfter the analysis, the students correctly ordered the densities of these bodies in the following way\nA) DB <DC\nB) db = from <dc\nC) dc <db = da\nD) db <dc <\nE) dc <db <da"
