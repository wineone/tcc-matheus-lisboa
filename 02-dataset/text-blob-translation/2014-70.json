  "text": "Question 70) In order to minimize environmental impacts, Brazilian law states that chemical waste released directly into the receptor body have a pH between 5.0 and 9.0. An aqueous liquid residue generated in an industrial process has a concentration of hydroxyl ions equal to 1.0 × 10−10 mol/L. To comply with the legislation, a chemist separated the following substances, available in the company's warehouse: CH3COOH, Na2SO4, CH3OH, K2CO3 and NH4Cl.\nSo that the residue can be thrown directly into the receiving body, what substance could be used to adjust the pH?\nA) CH3COOH\nB) Na2SO4\nC) CH3OH\nD) k2co3\nE) NH4Cl"
