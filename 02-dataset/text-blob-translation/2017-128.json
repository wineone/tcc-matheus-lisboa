  "text": "Question 123) Laser epilation (popularly known as laser hair removal) consists of applying a light source to heat and causing a localized and controlled lesion in the hair follicles. To prevent other tissues from being damaged, wavelengths are selected that are absorbed by melanin present in the hair, but do not affect blood oxyhemoglobin and water from tissues in the region where treatment will be applied. Figure shows how it is the absorption of different wavelengths through melanin, oxyhemoglobin and water.\nAbsorption (%) wavelength (nm) melanin 50.0 37.5 25.0 12.5 0 400 500 600 700 800 900 1 000 1 100 Oxi-Hemoglobin Water Macedo, F. S.; MONTEIRO, E. O. epilation with laser and intense pulsed light. What is the wavelength, in NM, ideal for laser epilation?\nA) 400\nB) 700\nC) 1 100\nD) 900\nE) 500"
