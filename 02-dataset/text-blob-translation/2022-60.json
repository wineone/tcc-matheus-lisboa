  "text": "QUESTION 55) Saline or allomorphic soils have as a common characteristic a very high concentration of soluble salts and/or exchangable sodium. They occur in the lowest places of relief, in arid and semi -arid regions and near the sea. In semiarid regions, for example, the drought polygon of northeastern Brazil, the least high places receive water that flows from adjacent slopes, during rains that fall in some months of the year. This water brings solutions of mineral salts and evaporates quickly before infiltrating itself, and then, each time this process is repeated, a small accumulation of salts on the superficial horizon that, over the years, causes salinization of ground. In recent decades, the expansion of agricultural activities in the region has expanded this process.\nLEPSCH, I. F. Soils: formation and conservation.
