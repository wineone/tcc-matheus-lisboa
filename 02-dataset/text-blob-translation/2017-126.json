  "text": "Question 121) Some types of desalinitors use the reverse osmosis process to obtain drinking water from salt water. In this method, a container containing two compartments separated by a semipermeable membrane is used: in one of them, salt water is placed and the other is collected drinking water. Mechanical pressure application in the system makes water flow from one compartment to another. The movement of water molecules through the membrane is controlled by osmotic pressure and applied mechanical pressure.\nFor this process to occur it is necessary that those resulting from the osmotic and mechanical pressures\nA) Same sense and same intensity.\nB) opposite senses and the same intensity.\nC) opposite senses and greater intensity of osmotic pressure.\nD) same sense and greater intensity of osmotic pressure.\nE) opposite senses and greater intensity of mechanical pressure."
