  "text": "QUESTION 130) In some homes, electrified fences are used in order to remove possible invaders. An electrific fence works with an electrical potential difference of approximately 10 000 V. In order not to be lethal, the current that can be transmitted through a person should not be greater than 0.01 A. A person's hands and feet is in the order of 1 000 Î©.\nSo that the current is not lethal to a person who touches the electrific fence, the voltage generator must have an internal resistance that, in relation to that of the human body, is\nA) Practically null.\nB) approximately the same.\nC) Thousands of times larger.\nD) of the order of 10 times larger.\nE) of the order of 10 times smaller."
