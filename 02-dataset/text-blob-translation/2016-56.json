  "text": "Question 56) Proteins of an eukaryotic cell have signal peptides, which are sequences of amino acids responsible for their address to different organelles, according to their functions. A researcher has developed a nanoparticle capable of loading proteins into specific cell types. Now he wants to know if a nanoparticle charged with a protein blocking of the in vitro Krebs cycle is able to exercise his activity into a cancerous cell and can cut the energy contribution and destroy these cells.\nWhen choosing this blocker protein to load nanoparticles, the researcher should take into account an addressing signal to which organela?\nA) nucleus.\nB) mitochondria.\nC) Peroxisome.\nD) Golgiense complex.\nE) endoplasmic reticulum."
