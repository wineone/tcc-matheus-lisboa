  "text": "Question 54) During the first phase of the project of an electricity generation plant, environmental impact evaluation team engineers seek to know if this project is in accordance with environmental standards. The new plant will be located on the edge of a river, whose average water temperature is 25 ° C, and will use its water for refrigeration only. The project aims that the plant operate with 1.0 MW of electric power and, due to technical restrictions, twice this power will be dissipated by its cooling system, in the form of heat. To serve resolution number 430, of May 13, 2011, of the National Environment Council, with a wide safety margin, engineers determined that water can only be returned to the river with a temperature increase of at most, 3 ° C in relation to the water temperature of the river captured by the cooling system. Consider the specific heat of water equal to 4 kJ/(kg ° C).\nTo meet this determination, the minimum value of water flow, in kg/s, for the refrigeration of the plant must be closer to\nA) 42.\nB) 84.\nC) 167.\nD) 250.\nE) 500."
