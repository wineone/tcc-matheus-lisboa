  "text": "QUESTION 79) High combustion temperatures and friction between their moving parts are some of the factors that cause engines to warm into internal combustion. To avoid overheating and consequent damage to these engines, the current cooling systems were developed, in which a cooler fluid with special properties circulates inside the engine, absorbing the heat that, when passing through the radiator, is transferred to the atmosphere.\nWhat property does the cooler fluid have to fulfill its goal more efficiently?\nA) High specific heat.\nB) High fusion latent heat.\nC) low thermal conductivity.\nD) Low boiling temperature.\nE) High coefficient of thermal expansion."
