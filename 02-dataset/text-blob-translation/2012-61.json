  "text": "Question 61) The efficiency of the lamps can be compared using reason, considered linear, between the amount of light produced and consumption. The amount of light is measured by the luminous flow, whose unit is the lumen (LM). Consumption is related to the electric power of the lamp that is measured in Watt (W). For example, an incandescent 40 W lamp emits about 600 lm, while a 40 W fluorescent lamp emits about 3 000 lm.\nThe efficiency of an incandescent 40 W lamp is\nA) Greater than an 8 W fluorescent lamp, which produces less light.\nB) greater than that of a 40 W fluorescent lamp, which produces less light.\nC) less than that of an 8 W fluorescent lamp, which produces the same amount of light.\nD) less than that of a 40 W fluorescent lamp as it consumes more energy.\nE) equal to that of a 40 W fluorescent lamp, which consumes the same amount of energy."
