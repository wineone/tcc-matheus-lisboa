  "text": "Question 129) Most people get their vision blurred as they open their eyes under the water. But there is one exception: the Moken people, who inhabits the coast of Thailand. This feature is mainly due to the adaptability of the eye and the plasticity of the brain, which means that you, with some training, could see relatively right underwater. Studies have shown that the eye pupils of moken individuals suffer significant reduction underwater, which causes the bright rays to incidence almost parallel to the optical axis of the pupil.\nGISLÃ‰N, A. et al. Visual Training Improves Underwater Vision in Children. Visual acuity associated with pupil reduction is physically explained by the decrease\nA) the luminous intensity incident on the retina.\nB) the diffraction of the luminous beams that cross the pupil.\nC) the intensity of the luminous beams in a direction by polarization.\nD) Deviation from refracted light beams inside the eye.\nE) the reflections of the luminous beams inside the eye."
