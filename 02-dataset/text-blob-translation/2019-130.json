  "text": "Question 125) Glycolysis is a process that occurs in cells, converting glucose to pyruvate. During the practice of physical exercise that demand a large amount of effort, glucose is completely oxidized in the presence of O2. However, in some cases, muscle cells may suffer an O2 deficit and glucose be converted into two lactic acid molecules. The thermochemical equations for the combustion of glucose and lactic acid are, respectively, shown below: C6H12O6 (s) + 6 O2 (g) → 6 CO2 (g) + 6 H2O (L) ∆CH = −2 800 kJ CH3CH (OH) COOH (s) + 3 O2 (g) → 3 CO2 (g) + 3 H2O (L) ∆CH = −1 344 kJ The anaerobic process is less energetically advantageous because\nA) releases 112 kJ per mol of glucose.\nB) releases 467 kJ by mol of glucose.\nC) releases 2 688 kJ per mol of glucose.\nD) absorbs 1 344 kJ per mol of glucose.\nE) absorbs 2 800 kJ per mol of glucose."
