  "text": "Question 73) Ecosystems degraded by intense agricultural activity usually have a decrease in their diversity and loss of their stability. In this context, integrated use of trees to agricultural systems (agroforestry systems) can play an innovative role by seeking the acceleration of the successional process and, at the same time, staggered and diverse production.\nThis is a strategy of reconciliation between environmental recovery and agricultural production, because\nA) Gradually replaces the species cultivable with tree species.\nB) intensify soil fertilization with the use of appropriate and biocidic techniques.\nC) promotes greater diversity of soil life with increasing organic matter.\nD) favors the dispersion of seeds cultivated by fauna resident in forest areas.\nE) Creates conditions for the establishment of pioneering species with decreased insolation on the soil."
