  "text": "Question 73) The pump reduces neutral and neutrinos, and shakes with the range of chain reaction Andrade, C. D. Complete poetry and prose. Rio de Janeiro: Aguilar, 1973 (fragment).\nIn this poem fragment, the author refers to the atomic bomb of uranium. This reaction is said “in chain” because in\nA) Fission of 235U occurs release of large amount of heat, which continues the reaction.\nB) Fission of 235U occurs energy release, which disintegrates Isotope 238u, enriching it by 235U.\nC) Fission of 235U occurs a release of neutrons, which will bombard other nuclei.\nD) merger of 235U with 238u occurs neutrino formation, which will bombard other radioactive nuclei.\nE) merger of 235U with 238U occurs other heavier radioactive elements, which trigger new fusion processes."
