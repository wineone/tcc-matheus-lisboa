  "text": "Question 90) Green chemistry allows technological development with reduced environmental damage, and finding clean routes has been a big challenge. Consider two different routes used to obtain adipic acid, a very important input for the textile and plasticizer industry.\nTraditional Route (Brown) Green Route + + OH OH 4 H2O + OH OH OOH CO 180 ° C 75-90 ° C 120 ° C HNO3 60% V5 +, Cu Cr (III) Caustic Wash OH CO2 NA2WO4, 4 H2O2 + N2O Factor contributes positively to the second synthesis route to be green compared to the first?\nA) Single step in synthesis.\nB) obtaining the pure product.\nC) absence of oxidizing reagents.\nD) absence of metal elements in the process.\nE) void energy expenditure on the separation of the product."
