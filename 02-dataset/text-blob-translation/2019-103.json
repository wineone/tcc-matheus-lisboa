Consider that the main substance responsible for garlic odor is allicin (structure I) and that for the odor to be eliminated, it is transformed into structure II.\nStructure I CH2 ═ CH - CH2 - S - S - S - CH2 - CH ═ CH2 Structure II In the conversion of i into II, the \"soap\" will act as a\nA) acid.\nB) Reducer.\nC) electrolyte.\nD) surface.\nE) catalyst."
