  "text": "Question 134) One cook put more salt in the beans that was cooking. To solve the problem, she added raw potatoes and without spice inside the pan. When it finished cooking it, the potatoes were salted because they absorbed part of the broth with excess salt. Finally, she added water to complete the bean stock.\nSalt was absorbed by potatoes by\nA) Osmosis, as it only involves the transport of the solvent.\nB) phagocytosis, because salt transported is a solid substance.\nC) Exocytosis, since salt was transported from water to potato.\nD) Pinocytosis, because the salt was diluted in the water when it was transported.\nE) diffusion, because transportation occurred in favor of the concentration gradient."
