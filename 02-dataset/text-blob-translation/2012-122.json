  "text": "Question 117) Cabeludinho When Grandma received me on vacation, she introduced me to friends: this is my grandson. He went to study in Rio and returned from atheist. She said I came back from an atheist. That displaced preposition fantasized me as an atheist. As who said at Carnival: that boy is fantasized as a clown. My grandmother understood verbal regencies. She talked seriously. But all-world laughed. Because that displaced preposition could make information a jam. And did. What's more, I think seeking beauty in words is a solemnity of love. And can be an instrument of laughing. Otherwise, in the middle of the naked one boy shouted: this dysilimine, hairy. I didn't afford anyone. But that new verb brought a perfume of poetry to our court. I learned on this vacation to play words more than working with them. I started not to like the Word shelved. The one that cannot change places. I learned to like the words more for what they sing than what they report. Then I heard a cowboy sing with longing: Oh brunette, do not write me / that I do not know reading. That the mayor of the verb read, when he heard, widened the loneliness of the cowboy.\nBARROS, M. Invented memories: Childhood. Sao Paulo: Planet, 2003.\nIn the text, the author develops a reflection on different possibilities for language use and the senses that these uses can produce, such as the expressions “returned from atheist”, “dysilimine this” and “I don't know to read”. With this reflection, the author highlights\nA) The linguistic deviations committed by the characters of the text.\nB) the importance of certain grammatical phenomena for the knowledge of the Portuguese language.\nC) the clear distinction between the cultured norm and the other linguistic varieties.\nD) The faithful account of episodes experienced by Cabeludinho during his vacation.\nE) the valorization of the playful and poetic dimension present in the colloquial uses of language."
