  "text": "Question 46) In its formulation, pepper spray contains varied percentages of capsicum oleorresine, whose active ingredient is capsaicin, and a solvent (an alcohol such as ethanol or isopropanol). In contact with eyes, skin or respiratory tract, capsaicin causes an infl effect that generates a sense of pain and burning, leading to temporary blindness. The process is triggered by the release of neuropeptides from nerve endings.\nWhen a person is hit with the pepper spray in the eyes or skin, the wash of the region hit with water is ineffective because the\nA) Reaction between ethanol and water releases heat, intensifying the ardor.\nB) solubility of the active ingredient in water is very low, difficult to remove.\nC) Water permeability on the skin is very high, not allowing the removal of the active ingredient.\nD) Oil solubilization in water causes greater spread beyond the affected areas.\nE) burning makes water quickly evaporate, not allowing contact between oil and solvent."
