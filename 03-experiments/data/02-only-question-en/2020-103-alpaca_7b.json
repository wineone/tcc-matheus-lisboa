  "result": " 98) Spider, scorpions, ticks and mites are representative of the Araneae class. These animals are terrestrial mostly and occupy the most varied habitats, such as high mountains, marshes, deserts and sandy soils. They may have been the first representatives of the Arthropoda phylum to inhabit the dry land. The characteristic that justifies their adaptive success in this environment is the presence of: A) Chelicerae and pedipalps that coordinate body movement. B) Excretion of uric acid that gives stability to body pH. C) Exoskeleton consisting of chitin that assists in body water control. D) Open blood circulation that prevents dehydration of bodily tissues. E) Ganglionic nervous system that promotes the central coordination of body movement."
