The Church resumed a distance of six months between the births of Jesus Christ and John the Baptist and instituted the date of commemoration of the latter in such a way that the European Summer Solstice festivals with their traditional bonfires became “bonfires of St. John”. The feast of fire and light, however, was not immediately associated with St. John the Baptist. In the low Middle Ages, some traditional party practices (such as baths, dances and corners) were chased by monks and bishops. From the Council of Trent (1545-1563), the Church decided to adopt celebrations around fire and associate them with Christian doctrine."
