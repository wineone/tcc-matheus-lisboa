  "result": " D) formation of deep aquifers. The text describes a physical phenomenon that affects populations near areas of geological tension, which is the formation of deep aquifers. This type of earthquake occurs when there is an increase in pressure on the Earth's surface, causing the ground to move and create fissures or cracks in the soil. These movements can cause vibrations that are felt by people living near the area, leading them to experience a sense of fear due to the unforeseen event."
