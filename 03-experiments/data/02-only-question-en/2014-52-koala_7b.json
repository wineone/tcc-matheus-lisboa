  "result": " A) react with each other. Thalidomide is a racemic mixture composed of two enantiomers, R and S. When administered to pregnant women, it was not known that the enantiomer S leads to congenital malformation, mainly affecting the normal development of the baby's arms and legs. This congenital malformation occurs because these enantiomers react with each other in a way that is not fully understood. The exact mechanism of this reaction is not known, but it is thought to involve the interaction between the two enantiomers and their ability to bind to specific receptors in the developing fetus. This interaction can lead to changes in the development of the baby's limbs, resulting in congenital malformations such as shortened arms and legs."
