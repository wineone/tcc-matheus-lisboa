Usually, when I lost sleep, the beatings of the pendua were very badly; This crumbly, slow, dry tickery seemed to tell every blow that I was going to have a less life. He then imagined an old devil, sitting between two bags, that of life and that of death, and to tell them like this: - Another less ... - Another less ... - Another less ... The most unique thing is that if the clock stopped, I would go, so that it would never stop beating, and I could tell all my lost moments. Invention are, which transform or end; The same institutions die; The clock is definitive and perpetual. The ultimate man, saying goodbye to the cold and spent sun, will have a clock in the pocket, to find out the exact time when he dies. That night I did not suffer this sad feeling of boring, but another, and delightful. The fantasies tumultured inside me, they came to each other, like devouts who collapsed to see the processions-angel. I didn't hear the lost moments, but the minutes gained."
