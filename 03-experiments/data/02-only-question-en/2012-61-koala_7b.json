  "result": " A) Greater than an 8 W fluorescent lamp, which produces less light. The efficiency of an incandescent lamp is defined as the ratio of the luminous flux produced to the electrical power consumed. In this case, the luminous flux produced by an incandescent lamp is directly related to its wattage and the electrical power consumed is directly related to the wattage. Therefore, the efficiency of an incandescent lamp is greater than that of a fluorescent lamp with a lower wattage."
