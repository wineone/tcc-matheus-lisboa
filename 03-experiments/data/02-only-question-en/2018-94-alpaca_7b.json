  "result": " Queestion 89) In the early 1990s, two important biologists, Redford and Robinson, produced a widely accepted model of “sustainable production” that predicted how many individuals in each species could be sustainable huntd based on their reproduction rates. The rubber tings of Altro Juruá had a different model: whom they told them that they were hunting above the sustainable (within the model), they said no, that the level of hunting depended on the existece of areas of refuge in which no one huntd. Now, this turned out to be the model baptized as a “source-ral” proposed ten years after the first by Novaro, Bodmer and the Redford itself and that supplanted the previous model."
