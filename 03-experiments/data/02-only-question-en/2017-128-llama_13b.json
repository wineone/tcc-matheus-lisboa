To prevent other tissues from being damaged, wavelengths are selected that are absorbed by melanin present in the hair, but do not affect blood oxyhemoglobin and water from tissues in the region where treatment will be applied. Figure shows how it is the absorption of different wavelengths through melanin, oxyhemoglobin and water."
