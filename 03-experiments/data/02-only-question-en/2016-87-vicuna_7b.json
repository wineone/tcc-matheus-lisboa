  "result": " E) dehydration. Diabetes insipidus is a rare disorder that affects the production or functioning of the antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which regulates water reabsorption by the renal tubules. The most common symptom of diabetes insipidus is dehydration, characterized by excessive urination and a strong thirst. This symptom occurs because the kidneys are unable to retain water due to the lack of ADH, leading to an increased excretion of water in the urine. The other options listed are not typical symptoms of diabetes insipidus."
