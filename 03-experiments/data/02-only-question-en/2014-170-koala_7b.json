  "result": " A) x ⋅ y ⋅ zExplanation: The number of divisors of n, different from n, is given by the formula: d = 2g - 1, where g is the greatest common divisor of n and its reciprocal. Since n is a multiple of 10 and is not a multiple of 7, we know that g = 10 and g' = 1. Therefore, d = 2(10) - 1 = 20 - 1 = 19."
