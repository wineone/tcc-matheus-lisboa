  "result": " A) volatilization of substances of interest. The collection of essential oils from plants is typically performed at dawn, when the temperature and humidity are low, to minimize the risk of damage to the plant material. This allows for the release of volatile compounds that can be collected using a variety of methods, including distillation or solvent extraction. The scientific explanation for this practice is based on the fact that certain essential oils have a higher concentration at dawn than at other times of day, and that the low temperature and humidity conditions during this time can help to preserve the integrity of these compounds."
