  "result": " D. Xenon is a gas that emits light in the visible spectrum, but it also has a high energy emission in the infrared region. The human eye is more sensitive to the visible range of wavelengths than to the infrared. Therefore, xenon lamps are not suitable for illuminating rooms because they emit too much heat."
