  "result": " A) Addressed subliminarilly, through expressions such as “Arlequinal Heart” that, evoking the carnival, refers to Brazilianness. B) already verified in the title, which refers to the northeastern feelings, studied by Mário de Andrade in their travels and folkloric research. C) lamented by the lyrical self, both in the use of expressions and “feeling in me of the harsh” (v. 1), “cold” (v. 6), “siick soul” (v. 7), as the sad sound of \"Dlorom\" lute (v. 9). D) problematized in the opposition Tupe (wild) x Lute (civilized), pointing to the national synthesis that would be proposed in the Anthropophage Manifesto, by Oswald de Andrade. E) exalted by the lyrical self, which evokes the “feeling of men of the first ages” to show Brazilian pride for their indigenous roots."
