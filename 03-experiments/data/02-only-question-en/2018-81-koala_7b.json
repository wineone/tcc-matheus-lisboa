  "result": " A) neglect of Christian religions about diseases. The criminal code of 1890, which was in force during the First Republic, did not show any preference for traditional beliefs or the use of magic therapeutic practices. Instead, it emphasized the importance of Christian religious teachings and the role of God in healing. It also criminalized the practice of medicine without proper qualifications, including the use of homeopathy, dosimetry, hypnotism, and animal magnetism. This reflects a broader trend in Brazilian society towards the adoption of Western medical practices and the rejection of traditional beliefs and practices."
