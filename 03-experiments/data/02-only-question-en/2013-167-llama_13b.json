  "result": " Answer 162) In September 1987, Goiânia was the scene of the largest radioactive accident in Brazil, when a sample of cesium-137, removed from an abandoned radiotherapy device, was inadvertently manipulated by the population. The half-life of a radioactive material is the time required for the mass of this material to be halved. The cesium-137 half-life is 30 years and the remaining amount of mass of a radioactive material, after t years, is calculated by the expression m (t) = a · (2.7) kt, where A is the initial mass and k is a negative constant."
