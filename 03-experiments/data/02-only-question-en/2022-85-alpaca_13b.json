  "result": " Question 80) Advent of Polis, birth of philosophy: Between the two orders of phenomena, the bonds are too narrow so that rational thinking does not appear, in its origins, solidarity of the social and mental structures of the Greek city. Thus replaced in history, philosophy is stripped of this character of absolute revelation that was sometimes attributed to him, greeking, in the young science of the Jonia, the timeless reason that became incarnate in time. The Milettan school has not seen the reason born; She built a reason, a first form of rationality. This Greek reason is not the experimental reason for contemporary science."
