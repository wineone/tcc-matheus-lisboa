  "result": " Queestión 97) United States researchers developed a new technique, which uses infrarede light rays (invisible to the naked eye) to destroy tumors. First, the patient receives an injection with modified versions of antibodies that have the ability to “stick” only in cancer cells. Alone, they do nothing against the tumor. However, these antibodies are linked to a molecule, called IR700, which will function as a \"microreactor\" that will destroy cancer. Then the patient receives infrarede light rays. These rays penetrate the body and reach the IR700 molecule, which is activated and releases a substance that attacks the cancerous cell. Based on the development steps, the appropriate name for the described technique is: A) Radiotherapy. B) Chromotherapy. C) Chemotherapy. D) Phototherapy. E) Magnetic therapy."
