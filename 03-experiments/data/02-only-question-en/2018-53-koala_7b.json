  "result": " A) Ideological imposition and hierarchical norms. The political model of societies discussed in the text is based on ideological imposition and hierarchical norms, which means that the society is organized around a set of beliefs and values that are considered to be true and universal. This model is characterized by the idea that there is one truth and one way of thinking, and that all other ways of thinking are false or inferior. The society is also hierarchical, meaning that there is a clear division between different groups and individuals, with some being more powerful than others."
