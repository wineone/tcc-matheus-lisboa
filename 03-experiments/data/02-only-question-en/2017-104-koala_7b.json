  "result": " The best lamp to meet the architect's desire would be a metal halide lamp, as it produces light in the visible spectrum and does not produce heat. Metal halide lamps are commonly used for outdoor lighting because they produce bright white light that is not harmful to plants and animals. They also have a relatively low power consumption compared to other types of lamps."
