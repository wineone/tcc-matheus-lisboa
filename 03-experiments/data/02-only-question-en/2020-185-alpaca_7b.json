  "result": " Pergole are usually made of wood or metal, but can also be made of other materials such as stone, glass, or plastic. The size and shape of pergole vary greatly depending on the architect's design. They can range from simple structures with just one beam to complex designs with multiple beams and intricate shapes. Pergole are often used in gardens and courtyards to provide shade and protection from the elements, while still allowing light and air to pass through."
