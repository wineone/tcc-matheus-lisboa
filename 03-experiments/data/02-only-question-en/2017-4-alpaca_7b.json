I Am Not Judging Their Lifestyle of Introducing Guns to Children at Young Age, But It's Irresponsible Not to Practice Basic Safety with Anyting Potentially Lethal - Guns, Knives, Fire and so. How Can Anyone Justify Leaving Guns Lying Around, Unlocked and Possibly Loaded, in a Home with Two Young Children? I Wish the Family of the Victim Comfort During This Difficult Time, But to Dismisses This an Accident Leaves Open the Potential For Many More Such “Accidents” to Occur. I hope this Doesn't Have to Make Up Seven More Times for Legislators to Perform That Something Needs to Be Changed."
