To perform this design, it has only one measure at the moment, whose length of the rods is 10 cm, a transfer and a sheet of paper with a Cartesian plane. To sketch the design of this lid, she pushed the stems out of her compass so that the angle formed by them was 120 Â°. The dried tip is represented by point C, the tip of the graph is represented by point B and the head of the compass is represented by point A as figure."
