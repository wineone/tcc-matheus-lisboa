  "result": " 89) The integrated cultivation technique of animals and algae is a proposal favorable to a more balanced ecosystem because A) Animal eliminate heavy metal residues from industrial tailings thrown into water; B) Animal provide nitrogenous organic excretion, which are transformed into carbon dioxide by algae; C) Algae use nitrogen residues released by animals and eliminate carbon dioxide in photosynthesis used in aerobic respiration; D) Algae use nitrogenous waste from animal metabolism and, during the synthesis of organic compounds, release oxygen to the environment; E) Algae take advantage of the residues of animal metabolism and, during chemosynthesis of organic compounds, release oxygen to the environment."
