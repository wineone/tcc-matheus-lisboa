  "result": " 98) In order to explain one of the properties of the plasma membrane, a mouse cell with a human cell was fused, forming a hybrid cell. Then, in order to mark membrane proteins, two antibodies were inserted into the experiment, one specific for mouse membrane protein and another for human membrane protein. The antibodies were visualized under the microscope by fluorescence of different colors."
