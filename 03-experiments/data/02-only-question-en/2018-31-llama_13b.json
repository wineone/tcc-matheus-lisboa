  "result": " Answer 26) Both the Olympic and Paralympic Games are more than a race for records, medals and search for excellence. Behind them is the philosophy of Baron Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the Olympic movement. As an educator, he saw in games the opportunity for people to develop values, which could be applied not only to sport, but to education and society. There are currently seven values ​​associated with games. Olympic values ​​are: friendship, excellence and respect, while paralympic values ​​are: determination, courage, equality and inspiration."
