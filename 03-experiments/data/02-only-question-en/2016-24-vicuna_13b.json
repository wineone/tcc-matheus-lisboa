  "result": " Deliberative democracy is that parts of the political conflict must deliberate among themselves and, through reasonable argument, try to reach an agreement on policies that are satisfactory to all. Activist democracy suspiciously of exhortations to deliberation because it believes that in the real world of politics, where structural inequalities influence procedures and results, democratic processes that seem to fulfill deliberation norms often tend to benefit the most powerful agents. It therefore recommends that those who care about the promotion of more justice should mainly perform critical opposition activity, rather than trying to reach an agreement with those who support existing power structures or benefit from them."
