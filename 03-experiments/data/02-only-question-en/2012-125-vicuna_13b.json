  "result": " Text I and II present characteristics that are typical of radio orality. In text I, the characteristic of radio orality would be the one that proposes dialogue with the listener through simplicity, concision and coherence, as well as the rhythm marked by the speaker. These features aim to give melody to oral transmission and emotion and personality to the actual account. In text II, the letter presents a simple style and is marked by dialogue with the receiver, which are typical of radio communication. The lyricism in approaching the problem removes it from a possible real situation of radio communication, but the rhythmic marking of the verses shows that the text belongs to a different communication modality from radio. Additionally, the direction of the text to a specific listener diverges from the purpose of radio communication, which is to reach the masses. However, there is objectivity in language characterized by the rare occurrence of adjectives, in order to reduce the marks of subjectivity of the speaker."
