Until you put yourself with a straight body, there were 13 pasts, showing your power during acceleration, the most important moment of the race. At the end of this route, Bolt had reached a top speed of 12 m/s. Assuming that the mass of this corridor is 90 kg, the total work done in the first 13 pasts is closer to: A) 5.4 × 102 J. B) 6.5 × 103 J. C) 8.6 × 103 J. D) 1.3 × 104 J. E) 3.2 × 104 J."
