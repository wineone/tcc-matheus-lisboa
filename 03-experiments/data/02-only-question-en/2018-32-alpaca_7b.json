  "result": " Queesti√≥n 27) More big than Bang The world scientific community received last week the official confirmation of a discovery about which it was spoken with huge expectation a few months ago. Researchers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Astrophysics Center have revealed that they have obtained the strongest evidence so far that the universe we lived in the Big Bang, but this was no explosion, but a sudden expansion of infinite matter and energy concentrated at one point Microscopic that, without many semantic options, scientists call \"singularity.\" This cosmic seed remained in a latent state and, without still a definitive explanation, began to swell quickly [...]. At the break of a blink of an eye, for example, it would be possible, therefore, to occur more than 10 trillion Big Bangs."
