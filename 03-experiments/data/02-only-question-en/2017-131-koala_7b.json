  "result": " A) The added salt decreases the concentration of solutes inside.Salt preservation involves adding a high concentration of sodium chloride (NaCl) to food, which draws out moisture and increases the concentration of salts. This process can help preserve the food by reducing the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms that require water to survive. The added salt also helps to preserve the texture and flavor of the food. However, it is important to note that adding too much salt can cause the food to spoil more quickly, so it is important to find a balance between preserving the food and maintaining its quality."
