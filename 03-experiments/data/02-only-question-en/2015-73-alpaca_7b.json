  "result": " Queest√£o 74) A) Fission of 235U occurs release of large amount of heat, which continues the reaction. B) Fission of 235U occurs energy release, which disintegrates Isotope 238u, enriching it by 235U. C) Fission of 235U occurs a release of neutrons, which will bombard other nuclei. D) merger of 235U with 238u occurs neutrino formation, which will bombard other radioactive nuclei. E) merger of 235U with 238U occurs the release of other heavier radioactive elements, which trigger new fusion processes."
