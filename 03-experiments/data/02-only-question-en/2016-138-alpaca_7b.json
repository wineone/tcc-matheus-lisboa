  "result": " Pirilaampu (firefly) has an interesting birth certificate. Suddenly, at the end of the seventeenth century, the poets of Lisbon noticed that they could not sing the luminoous insect, although it was a source of metaphors, as it had an \"unseemly\" name that could not be used in serious papers: Caga-Lume. It was then that the dictionary Raphael Bluteau invented the new word, Pirilaampu, from the Greek pyra, meaning 'fire', and lamps, 'lamp'."
