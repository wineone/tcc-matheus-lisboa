  "result": " Answer 143) An industry has a water reservoir with a capacity of 900 m3. When there is a need to clean the reservoir, all the water needs to be drained. The water flow is done by six drains, and lasts 6 hours when the reservoir is full. This industry will build a new reservoir, with a capacity of 500 m3, whose water flow should be performed within 4 hours when the reservoir is full. The drains used in the new reservoir should be identical to those of the existing one."
