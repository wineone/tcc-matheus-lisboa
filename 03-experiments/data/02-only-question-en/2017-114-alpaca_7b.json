  "result": " Queestion 109) Researchers have been able to stimulate the absorption of light energy in plants thanks to the use of carbon nanotubees. For this, carbon nanotubees \"inserted\" inside the chloroplasts by a spontaneous montage through the chloroplast membranees. Plant pigmentes absorb light radiation, electrons are \"exciteed\" and move inside chloroplast membranees, and the plant then uses this electricity for the manufacture of sugars. Carbon nanotubees can absorb wavelengths commonly not used by chloroplasts, and researchers had the idea of ​​using them as \"antennae\", stimulating the conversion of solar energy by chloroplasts, with increasing electron transportation."
