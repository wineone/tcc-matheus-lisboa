  "result": " Queestion 102) Cuatias, small rodents of tropical zones, carry the seeds that fall from the trees by the mouth, but instead of eatng them, they burry them elsewhere. This procedure allows them to save most of their seeds buried to the driest times when there are no mature fruit available. Scientists have found that the cuties steal the seeds buried by others, and this \"thieves\" behavior makes the same seed be buried dozen of times."
