I Am Not Judging Their Lifestyle of Introduicing Guns to Children at Young Age, But It's But's Irresponsible Not to Practice Basic Safety with Anything Potentially Lethal - Guns, Knives, ﬁ ree and so. How Can Anyone Justify Leaving Guns Lying Around, Unlocked and Possibly Loaded, in a Home with Two Young Children? I Wish the Family of the Victim Comfort During This Dif iff Cult Time, But to Dismisses This A A Simple Accident Leaves Open the Potential For Many More Such “Accidents” to Occur. I hope this doesn´t have to make up seven more Times for legislators to perform that Somehing Needs to Be Changed."
