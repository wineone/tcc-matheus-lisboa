  "result": " Poets classify words by the soul because they like to play with them, and to play with them you need to have intimacy first. It is the soul of the word that defines, explains, offends or praises, puts itself between the signifier and the meaning to say what you want, give feeling to things, making sense. The word cloud rains. The sad word cries. The word sleep sleeps. The word time passes. The word fire burns. The word knife cuts. The word car runs. The word \"word\" says. What you want. And never descended later. Words have body and soul, but they are different from people at various points."
