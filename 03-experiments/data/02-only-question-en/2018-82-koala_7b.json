  "result": " A) arid with water deficit. The text describes a process of soil change that is favored by an arid climate with low humidity and water deficit. This type of climate is characterized by hot and dry summers and cold winters, which can lead to the formation of superficial accumulations such as sand masses, shells of gravel and pebbles and the widespread occurrence of rusting concretions that form a lateritic crust called \"yoke\"."
