  "result": " A) 2. The water flow in the new reservoir will be performed within 4 hours when the reservoir is full, and there are 6 drains. Therefore, the number of drains needed to empty the reservoir will be 6 / 4 = 1.5 drains. Since each drain can empty 900 m3 of water in 6 hours, the total amount of water that needs to be emptied from the new reservoir is 900 m3 x 1.5 drains = 1350 m3. Therefore, the number of drains needed to empty the new reservoir will be 1350 / 4 = 325 drains."
