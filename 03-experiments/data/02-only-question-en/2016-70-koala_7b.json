  "result": " A) known proportion between carbon-14 and carbon-12 in the atmosphere over the years. The text states that the carbon-14 dating technique is based on the known ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in the atmosphere, which has remained relatively constant over time. This knowledge allows researchers to accurately determine the age of a sample by comparing its carbon-14 content to a standard reference material with a known age."
