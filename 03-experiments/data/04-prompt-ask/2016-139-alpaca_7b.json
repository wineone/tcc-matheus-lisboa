  "result": " Lyriciism is so called because in other times the sentimental verse was declared to the sound of the lyre. Lyric poetry comprises lyrics, satire, didactic, epic and light. Lyric poetry is a personal expression of feeling, usually dealing with love or death. Elegiac lyrics deal with sad issues, almost always death. Bucolic lyrics deal with country affairs. Erotic lyrics deal with love. Neoclassical lyrics are based on the translation of classic poetical genres into modern language. Epitaphs are small verses written on tombstones."
