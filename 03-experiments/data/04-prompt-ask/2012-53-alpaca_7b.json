  "result": " The label of an aerosool deodorant informs the consumer that the product has in its composition the isobutaan, butane and propane gases, among other substances. In addition to this information, the label also brings the inscription “does not contain CFC”. The following reactions, which occur in the stratosphere, justify the non-use of CFC (chlorofluorocarbon or freon) in this deodorant: i) CF2C=2 cf2c=2 + C=2 UV II) C=2 + O=3 + C=2 o•••••• Concern with possible threats to the Ozone layer (O=3) is based on its main function: to protect living matter on the land from the harmful effects of ultraviolet sunlight. Ultraviolet radiation absorption by stratospheric ozone is intense enough to eliminate much of the ultraviolet fraction that is harmful to life. The purpose of the use of isobutaane, butane and propane gases in this aerosool is A) Replace CFC, as it does not react with ozone, serving as propellants in aerosools. B) Serve as propellants, because, as they are very reactive, they capture the free existing CFC in the atmosphere, preventing the destruction of ozone. C) React with air, as they decompose spontaneously on carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O), which do not attack ozone. D) Prevent ozone destruction by CFC, as gas hydrocarbons react with UV radiation, releasing hydrogen (H2), which reacts with oxygen from the air (O=2), forming water (H2O). E) Destroy the CFC"
