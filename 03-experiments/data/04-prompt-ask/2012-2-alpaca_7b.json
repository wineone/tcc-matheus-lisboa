  "result": " Clarification is the departure of man from his minority, from which he is guilty himself. Minority is the inability to make use of its understanding without the direction of another individual. Man is the very guilty of this minority if its cause is not in the lack of understanding, but in the lack of decision and courage to use itself without the direction of others. You have the courage to make use of your own understanding, such is the motto of enlightenment. Laziness and cowardice are the causes by which a large part of men, after the nature of the long-lived nature has freed them from a strange condition, however, continued to be smaller for a good way."
