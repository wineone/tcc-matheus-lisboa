  "result": " D</Question 79) The term \"burn\" refers to an injury caused by direct or indirect action produced by heat transfer to the body, which can manifest in different forms and degrees of severity. Burns are classified into four main categories based on their depth: first-degree burns (superficial skin damage), second-degree burns (partial thickness of the skin and underlying tissue), third-degree burns (full-thickness destruction of the skin and underlying tissue, including the dermis and subcutaneous tissue), and fourth-degree burns (destruction of all layers of the skin and underlying tissues)."
