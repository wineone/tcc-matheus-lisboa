  "result": " B</Question 43) Finding the basis of supposedly scientific arguments, the myth of fragile sex has historically contributed to controlling the body practices performed by women. In the history of Brazil, exactly in the transition between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the efforts to prevent the participation of women in the field of sports practices stand out. The suspicions about the presence of women in sport were culturally associated with the fear of masculinating the female body by intense physical effort. Regarding women's football, the fragile sex myth acted as an obstacle to consolidating the belief that physical exertion would be inappropriate to protect the femininity of “normal” woman. Such a myth sustained a strong movement contrary to the acceptance of football as a women's sport. Laws and advertisements sought to discredit football, considering it inappropriate to delicacy. In fact, women were considered unable to adapt to the multiple difficulties of “king sport”."
