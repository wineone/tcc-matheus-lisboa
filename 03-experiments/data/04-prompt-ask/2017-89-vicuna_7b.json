  "result": " B</Question 85) The concept of democracy, in Habermas's thinking, is built from a procedural dimension, based on discourse and deliberation. Democratic legitimacy requires the process of political decision making to occur from a broad public discussion, and only then decide. Thus, the deliberative character corresponds to a collective process of consideration and analysis, permeated by the discourse, which precedes the decision."
