  "result": " The correct answer is (B) 24 ml. According to the passage, the mixture should be \"completely filled\" a glass with a cylindrical shape and measurements of 10 cm high and 4 cm in diameter. This means that the volume of the mixture should be equal to the volume of the glass. The passage does not provide the exact volume of the glass, but it mentions that the amount of water used in the mixture is about 3 times the volume of the glass. Therefore, we can calculate the volume of the mixture as follows: Volume of mixture = 3 x Volume of glass Volume of glass = 10 cm high x 4 cm diameter = 40 cm^3 Volume of mixture = 40 cm^3 x 24 ml/cm^3 = 960 ml So, the correct answer is (B) 24 ml."
