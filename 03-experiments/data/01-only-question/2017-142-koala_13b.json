Explanation: To find the area of the smallest rectangle that can hold four wine glasses with their bases touching, we need to consider the following constraints: - The width of the rectangle must be at least as wide as the diameter of each wine glass (4 cm), so it should be at least 4 cm. - The height of the rectangle must be at least as tall as the diameter of each wine glass (5 cm), so it should be at least 5 cm. - The four wine glasses must fit in a single file, parallel to the longer side of the rectangle, and their bases must be fully supported by the rectangle. To find the area of the smallest rectangle that meets these constraints, we can use the formula: A = l x w, where A is the area, l is the length (the width of the rectangle), and w is the width (the diameter of each wine glass). Since the four wine glasses must fit in a single file, the length of the rectangle should be at least 4 cm + 5 cm = 9 cm. To find the smallest possible width that can hold four wine glasses with their bases touching, we need to consider the following: - The diameter of each wine glass is 4 cm, so the distance between the centers of adjacent wine glasses is 4 cm - 2 cm (the space between them). - To ensure that the bases of the wine glasses are fully supported by the rectangle, the width of the rectangle should be at least as wide as this distance. Since the diameter of each wine glass is 5 cm, the distance between the centers of adjacent wine glasses is 5 cm - 2 cm (the space between them). To find the smallest possible width that can hold four wine glasses with their bases touching, we need to consider the following: - The diameter of each wine glass is 4 cm,"
